# React - 10: Passing Data with Props in React

## Introduction

Props (short for "properties") are a core concept in React, serving as a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components. This article explains how to effectively pass data using props, set default values, and define prop types for better code reliability and readability.

## Understanding Props in React

Props are how components communicate with each other in React. They are read-only and should be considered immutable within a component.

### Basic Usage of Props

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

<Greeting name="Alice" />; // Usage
```

This code passes the `name` prop to the `Greeting` component, which displays the name.

## Setting Default Prop Values

Default props are used to ensure that components have default values if props aren't provided.

```jsx
function WelcomeMessage({ message = "Welcome to React!" }) {
  return <h1>{message}</h1>;
}

<WelcomeMessage /> // Displays default message
<WelcomeMessage message="Hello React" /> // Displays provided message
```

## Using PropTypes for Type Checking

PropTypes in React allows you to specify the types of props a component can receive. It helps catch bugs by validating data types of props.

```jsx
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

function User({ name, age }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

User.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number,
};

User.defaultProps = {
  age: 30,
};
```

## Advanced Prop Techniques

- **Destructuring Props**: Enhances readability and ease of use.

```jsx
function UserProfile({ name, bio }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>{bio}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Spread Operator with Props**: Useful for passing down all properties of an object as props.

```jsx
const userInfo = { name: "Alice", bio: "React Developer" };
<UserProfile {...userInfo} />;
```

## Prop Drilling and Context API

- **Prop Drilling**: Passing props down multiple levels of components. It can make components tightly coupled and harder to maintain.

- **Context API**: Provides a way to share values like these props between components without having to explicitly pass them through every level.

```jsx
const UserContext = React.createContext();

<UserContext.Provider value={userInfo}>
  <App />
</UserContext.Provider>;
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and effectively using props is vital for building component-based React applications. They provide a robust way to pass and manage data among components. The use of default props and PropTypes further enhances the robustness and maintainability of your React applications.
