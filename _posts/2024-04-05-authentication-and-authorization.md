# Building Secure Apps - 05: Authentication and Authorization

## Introduction

### Overview of Authentication and Authorization in Web Security

In the realm of web security, **authentication** and **authorization** are two fundamental pillars that determine how securely users interact with applications. **Authentication** is the process of verifying a user’s identity, ensuring they are who they claim to be. **Authorization**, on the other hand, is the system’s method of granting or restricting a user’s access to resources or actions within the application based on their role or permissions.

For example, in a banking application, authentication validates a user’s credentials (such as username and password) to log them into the system. Once logged in, authorization restricts or grants access to actions—such as viewing balance or transferring funds—based on the user’s role (e.g., regular user, admin).

When implemented securely, authentication and authorization mechanisms provide robust protection for sensitive user data, reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and ensure that users can only perform actions they are permitted to. However, improper implementation can open doors to various security risks, including unauthorized data access, session hijacking, and privilege escalation attacks.

### Importance of Secure Authentication and Authorization for Protecting User Data and Enforcing Access Control

As web applications continue to evolve, they become increasingly attractive targets for cyberattacks due to the vast amounts of sensitive data they handle—personal information, financial data, health records, and more. Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms is essential for:

1. **Protecting User Data**: With a secure authentication process, applications ensure that only legitimate users gain access, minimizing the likelihood of unauthorized individuals accessing sensitive data.
2. **Enforcing Access Control**: By implementing robust authorization protocols, applications can enforce strict control over which resources and functionalities are available to different users, reducing the risk of data breaches and malicious actions.
3. **Maintaining Trust and Compliance**: Secure authentication and authorization practices not only build trust among users but are also vital for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), which mandates stringent data protection measures.
