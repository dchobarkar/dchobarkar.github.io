# GraphQL - 04: Integrating GraphQL with Frontend Applications: A Practical Guide

## Introduction to Integrating GraphQL with Frontend Applications

In the contemporary landscape of web development, GraphQL has emerged as a transformative approach to designing and interacting with APIs. Its ability to allow clients to request exactly what they need and nothing more reduces over-fetching, under-fetching, and the need for multiple round-trips to the server, making it an invaluable asset in modern frontend development.

Following our exploration of setting up a GraphQL server, this article shifts focus to the frontend, detailing how developers can harness the power of GraphQL in their client-side applications. Whether you're building a complex enterprise-level application or a simple interactive UI, integrating GraphQL can significantly enhance your development workflow and application performance.

**Objectives**: Our goal is to demystify the process of integrating GraphQL APIs into frontend applications. By the end of this guide, you'll be familiar with using popular GraphQL clients like Apollo Client and Relay, understand their respective advantages, and be equipped with the knowledge to implement efficient state management practices in your applications.

## Using GraphQL on the Frontend

### Choosing a GraphQL Client

The choice of a GraphQL client is pivotal in how you interact with your GraphQL API from the frontend. A good client abstracts away the complexities of making network requests, caching responses, and managing application state, allowing you to focus on building your application.

- **Apollo Client** is renowned for its simplicity, extensive documentation, and comprehensive feature set, making it a go-to choice for many developers, especially those working on React applications.

- **Relay**, developed by Facebook alongside GraphQL, offers a more opinionated framework that excels in performance and scalability for larger applications, with features like automatic data masking and ahead-of-time compilation.

### Setting Up Apollo Client

Integrating Apollo Client with a React application is straightforward, thanks to its well-documented setup process and React-specific bindings.

**Step 1: Installing Apollo Client**:

```jsx
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

This command installs the Apollo Client library along with the GraphQL JavaScript library, which Apollo depends on.

**Step 2: Setting Up the ApolloProvider**:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Here, we configure Apollo Client with our GraphQL server's endpoint and wrap our application in the ApolloProvider, making the `Apollo Client` instance available throughout our React component tree.

### Relay: Advanced Use Cases

For developers working on larger, more complex applications, Relay offers advanced features and optimizations that can be particularly beneficial.

- Relay's **ahead-of-time compilation** of GraphQL queries ensures that only the minimal necessary data is fetched and that the queries are as efficient as possible.

- Its **automatic data masking** feature provides component-level data encapsulation, ensuring components only receive data they have explicitly requested.

**Choosing Relay Over Apollo Client**: While Apollo Client is suitable for a wide range of applications, Relay's specialized features make it the better choice for applications that require fine-tuned performance optimizations and are built around a complex data model.

## Building a Simple Frontend Application

### Example Application Overview

Let's consider building a simple blogging application that interacts with the GraphQL server we set up previously. This application will:

- Display a list of posts fetched from the GraphQL server.

- Allow users to add a new post through a mutation.

- Enable updating and deleting posts using GraphQL mutations.

This example will showcase how GraphQL can be seamlessly integrated into frontend applications to provide a dynamic user experience.

### Implementing Queries with Apollo Client

Fetching data from your GraphQL server is straightforward with Apollo Client's `useQuery` hook, which simplifies executing queries and managing their state in React applications.

**Code Snippet: Fetching Posts with `useQuery`**:

```jsx
import { useQuery, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const GET_POSTS = gql`
  query GetPosts {
    posts {
      id
      title
      author {
        name
      }
      body
    }
  }
`;

function Posts() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_POSTS);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      {data.posts.map(({ id, title, author, body }) => (
        <div key={id}>
          <h2>
            {title} by {author.name}
          </h2>
          <p>{body}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates how to define a GraphQL query and use the `useQuery` hook to fetch posts, displaying them within the component.

### Implementing Mutations with Apollo Client

Adding or updating data is equally intuitive with Apollo Client's `useMutation` hook, which provides an easy way to execute mutations.

**Code Snippet: Adding a New Post with `useMutation`**:

```jsx
import { useMutation, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const ADD_POST = gql`
  mutation AddPost($title: String!, $author: String!, $body: String!) {
    addPost(title: $title, author: $author, body: $body) {
      id
    }
  }
`;

function AddPost() {
  let title, author, body;
  const [addPost, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_POST);

  if (loading) return "Submitting...";
  if (error) return `Submission error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addPost({
            variables: {
              title: title.value,
              author: author.value,
              body: body.value,
            },
          });
          title.value = "";
          author.value = "";
          body.value = "";
        }}
      >
        <input ref={(value) => (title = value)} />
        <input ref={(value) => (author = value)} />
        <textarea ref={(value) => (body = value)} />
        <button type="submit">Add Post</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This code snippet illustrates how to use the `useMutation` hook to create a form for submitting new posts to the GraphQL server.

## State Management with GraphQL

### Simplifying State Management

One of the significant advantages of using GraphQL in frontend applications is its declarative nature, which can greatly simplify state management. Unlike traditional state management approaches that often require separate state management libraries, GraphQL, especially when used with Apollo Client or Relay, can manage both server-side and client-side state.

### Apollo Client: Local State Management

Apollo Client goes beyond just fetching data from a GraphQL server; it can also be used for managing local state within your application.

**Code Snippet: Managing Local State with Apollo Client**:

```jsx
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

const GET_LOCAL_STATE = gql`
  query GetLocalState {
    isLoggedIn @client
  }
`;

function Header() {
  const { data } = useQuery(GET_LOCAL_STATE);

  return (
    <div>
      {data.isLoggedIn ? <button>Log Out</button> : <button>Log In</button>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example shows how Apollo Client can query local state, using the `@client` directive to indicate that `isLoggedIn` is a local field.

### Advanced State Management with Relay

For applications with more complex data requirements, Relay provides advanced state management capabilities. Its ahead-of-time compilation and automatic data masking ensure that components fetch exactly what they need, no more, no less, contributing to performance optimizations and cleaner code.
