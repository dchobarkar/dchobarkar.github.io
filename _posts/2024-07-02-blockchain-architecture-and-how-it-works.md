        if hash_result[:difficulty] == "0" * difficulty:
            return nonce, hash_result
        nonce += 1

block_data = "Consensus Simulation"
difficulty = 4
nonce, block_hash = proof_of_work(block_data, difficulty)
print(f"Valid Nonce: {nonce}, Block Hash: {block_hash}")
```

### 📌 Proof of Stake (PoS): Economic Incentive-Driven Consensus

#### 🔹 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for Enhanced Privacy

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** allow one party to prove knowledge of a transaction **without revealing sensitive data**.
- **zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs** are used in privacy-focused blockchain projects like **Zcash and StarkWare** to enable **anonymous transactions while maintaining verifiability**.

#### 🔹 Multi-Signature (MultiSig) Wallets for Secure Asset Management

- Multi-signature wallets require **multiple cryptographic signatures** to authorize a transaction.
- This reduces the risk of **private key theft, single points of failure, and unauthorized fund transfers**.
- Commonly used in **corporate blockchain applications, decentralized finance (DeFi), and high-security crypto custody solutions**.
