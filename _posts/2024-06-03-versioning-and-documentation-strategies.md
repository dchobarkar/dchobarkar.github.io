## 🔄 API Versioning Approaches

API versioning plays a pivotal role in ensuring backward compatibility, facilitating new feature releases, and promoting seamless evolution without disrupting existing users. In this section, we'll explore four widely adopted versioning strategies, their applications, pros and cons, and practical code examples for real-world implementation.

### 1️⃣ URI Versioning

#### 🌐 Syntax Examples:

- `/v1/users`
- `/v2/orders`

#### ✅ Why Use URI Versioning?

- **Transparency:** API consumers can easily distinguish between different versions directly from the URL.
- **Caching Efficiency:** Ideal for web caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) due to predictable URLs.
- **Streamlined Routing:** Simplifies routing configurations, especially in RESTful architectures.

#### ❌ Challenges of URI Versioning:

- **Code Duplication:** Maintaining multiple versions might lead to repetitive codebases.
- **URL Clutter:** Over time, managing numerous versioned endpoints can become cumbersome.

#### 💻 Code Example: URI Versioning in Express.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/v1/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
});

app.get("/v2/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

### 2️⃣ Query Parameter Versioning

#### 🌟 Example Usage:

- `/api/users?version=1`
- `/api/users?version=2`

#### ✅ Advantages and Considerations:

- **Frontend Flexibility:** No changes required in the endpoint structure, making it easier for frontend teams.
- **Unified Endpoint Management:** Supports multiple versions under a single endpoint.
- **Caching Drawback:** Query parameters may not be optimally cached by certain CDNs.

#### 💻 Code Example: Query Parameter Versioning

```javascript
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  const { version } = req.query;
  if (version === "1") {
    res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
  } else if (version === "2") {
    res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
  } else {
    res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid API version" });
  }
});
```

### 3️⃣ Header Versioning

#### 🏷 Practical Example:

- `Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json`
- `Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v2+json`

#### ✅ Why Consider Header Versioning?

- **URL Cleanliness:** Keeps endpoints free from version identifiers.
- **Scalable for Large APIs:** Particularly suitable for microservices and complex enterprise architectures.

#### 💻 Code Example: Header Versioning in Express.js

```javascript
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  const version = req.headers["accept"];
  if (version.includes("vnd.myapp.v1")) {
    res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
  } else if (version.includes("vnd.myapp.v2")) {
    res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
  } else {
    res.status(400).json({ error: "Unsupported API version" });
  }
});
```

### 4️⃣ Content Negotiation

#### 📦 Understanding Content Negotiation:

- Clients define desired versions via `Accept` headers or MIME types.
- The server dynamically delivers the corresponding version.

#### ✅ Key Benefits:

- **Adaptive Version Management:** Easily accommodates evolving APIs without breaking existing clients.
- **Highly Flexible:** Ideal for applications that require dynamic data formats.

#### 💻 Code Example: Content Negotiation in NestJS

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Req, Res } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Request, Response } from "express";

@Controller("users")
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  getUsers(@Req() req: Request, @Res() res: Response) {
    const acceptHeader = req.headers["accept"];
    if (acceptHeader.includes("vnd.myapp.v1+json")) {
      res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
    } else if (acceptHeader.includes("vnd.myapp.v2+json")) {
      res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
    } else {
      res.status(400).json({ error: "Unsupported API version" });
    }
  }
}
```

### 🎯 Choosing the Right Versioning Strategy

When selecting an API versioning approach, developers must consider:

- **Project Scale:** Public APIs benefit from URI versioning for transparency.

#### 2️⃣ OpenAPI Definition in JSON

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "User API",
    "description": "API for managing users",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  ],
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Get all users",
        "responses": {

#### 3️⃣ Integrating OpenAPI Definitions into a Node.js App

Once an OpenAPI schema is defined, you can serve it dynamically in a **Node.js Express application**:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const swaggerUi = require("swagger-ui-express");
const swaggerDocument = require("./openapi.json"); // Load OpenAPI JSON file

const app = express();

app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000/api-docs");
});
```

After running this, visiting **`http://localhost:3000/api-docs`** will render an **interactive API documentation UI** powered by Swagger.

### 🏗 Integrating Swagger in Express.js and NestJS

#### 1️⃣ Integrating Swagger in Express.js

To integrate Swagger in an **Express.js application**, follow these steps:

##### 📌 Step 1: Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install swagger-ui-express swagger-jsdoc
```

##### 📌 Step 2: Define Swagger Configuration

Create a `swagger.js` file:

```javascript
const swaggerJsdoc = require("swagger-jsdoc");

const swaggerOptions = {
  definition: {
    openapi: "3.0.0",
    info: {
      title: "User API",
      version: "1.0.0",
      description: "API documentation for managing users",
    },
    servers: [{ url: "http://localhost:3000" }],
  },
  apis: ["./routes/*.js"], // Define paths to API route files
};

const swaggerDocs = swaggerJsdoc(swaggerOptions);
module.exports = swaggerDocs;
```

##### 📌 Step 3: Set Up Swagger UI in `server.js`

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const swaggerUi = require("swagger-ui-express");
const swaggerDocs = require("./swagger");

const app = express();

app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocs));

app.listen(3000, () =>
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000/api-docs")
);
```

#### 2️⃣ Advanced Configuration for NestJS APIs

NestJS provides built-in support for OpenAPI via the **`@nestjs/swagger`** package.

##### 📌 Step 1: Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
```

##### 📌 Step 2: Configure Swagger in `main.ts`

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { DocumentBuilder, SwaggerModule } from "@nestjs/swagger";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  const config = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle("User API")
    .setDescription("API documentation for user management")
    .setVersion("1.0")
    .addBearerAuth() // Adding JWT authentication
    .build();

  const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, config);
  SwaggerModule.setup("api-docs", app, document);

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

##### 📌 Step 3: Adding Swagger Annotations to Controllers

NestJS allows developers to use **decorators** to enhance API documentation.

Example **`users.controller.ts`**:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ApiTags, ApiOperation, ApiResponse, ApiBody } from "@nestjs/swagger";

@ApiTags("Users")
@Controller("users")
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  @ApiOperation({ summary: "Get all users" })
  @ApiResponse({ status: 200, description: "Returns all users" })
  getAllUsers() {
    return [
      { id: 1, name: "Alice" },
      { id: 2, name: "Bob" },
    ];
  }

  @Post()
  @ApiOperation({ summary: "Create a new user" })
  @ApiBody({
    schema: { example: { name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" } },
  })
  @ApiResponse({ status: 201, description: "User created successfully" })
  createUser(@Body() user) {
    return { id: 3, ...user };
  }
}
```

Now, when running the NestJS application, visiting **`http://localhost:3000/api-docs`** will provide an interactive Swagger UI with **auto-generated documentation**.

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

## 🌍 Real-World Example: Successful API Version Migration

API version migrations can be challenging, requiring careful planning to prevent breaking changes and disruptions. One of the most well-executed API versioning strategies in the industry comes from **Stripe**, a leading payment processing company. Stripe has managed to roll out new API versions while maintaining seamless backward compatibility, ensuring that its developers and customers can adopt new features without service interruptions.

### 🏢 Case Study: Stripe’s API Versioning Approach

#### 1️⃣ How Stripe Handles API Versioning

Stripe has built a reputation for its **developer-friendly API** and meticulous approach to **versioning**. Unlike some companies that enforce major version updates across all users, **Stripe allows clients to opt into newer API versions when they are ready**. This approach ensures:

- **No forced migrations** – Users can continue using older API versions until they choose to upgrade.
- **Granular change management** – Developers can test new features in a controlled environment before committing to an update.
- **Predictable upgrades** – Stripe documents every API change in detail, allowing developers to adapt with confidence.

##### 🔄 Versioning Mechanism

Instead of using **URI versioning** (`/v1/`, `/v2/`), Stripe relies on **header-based versioning**. Clients specify which version of the API they want to use through request headers.

```http
GET /customers HTTP/1.1
Host: api.stripe.com
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_xxx
Stripe-Version: 2023-01-01
```

By using headers, Stripe eliminates the need to change API endpoints, making version upgrades **smoother and more flexible**.

#### 2️⃣ Rolling Out New API Versions Without Disruptions

Stripe follows **a structured rollout process** for releasing new API versions, ensuring that existing integrations are not suddenly broken.

##### ✅ Incremental Changes

Instead of making **sweeping breaking changes**, Stripe releases **small, incremental updates** over time. This helps developers **gradually adapt** rather than needing to overhaul their applications all at once.

##### 🛠 Comprehensive Documentation & Changelogs

With every API update, Stripe provides:

- **Detailed changelogs** describing what has changed.
- **Migration guides** explaining how to transition from older versions.
- **Deprecation notices** highlighting features that will be phased out in future updates.

📌 **Example of Stripe’s changelog format:**

```markdown
## 2023-01-01 API Version Updates

- The `balance` field is now deprecated in favor of `account_balance`.
- Added `payment_status` field to the `charge` object.
- The `amount_refunded` field now returns in cents instead of dollars.
```

##### 🔄 Test Mode for API Versions

Stripe allows developers to test new versions in **sandbox mode**, making it easier to verify changes before deploying to production.

Developers can send requests specifying a new API version without affecting live transactions:

```http
GET /customers HTTP/1.1
Host: api.stripe.com
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_xxx
Stripe-Version: 2024-05-01
```

### 📊 Impact Analysis: The Benefits of Stripe’s Versioning Strategy

📌 **Example of a Stripe API Response Before and After Migration**

**Before Migration (`2023-01-01` version):**

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cus_12345",
  "balance": 5000,
  "currency": "usd"
}
```

**After Migration (`2024-05-01` version):**

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cus_12345",
  "account_balance": {
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "usd"
  }
}
```

In this change, Stripe migrated the `balance` field to a new structured `account_balance` object without disrupting existing functionality.
