## 🔄 API Versioning Approaches

API versioning plays a pivotal role in ensuring backward compatibility, facilitating new feature releases, and promoting seamless evolution without disrupting existing users. In this section, we'll explore four widely adopted versioning strategies, their applications, pros and cons, and practical code examples for real-world implementation.

### 1️⃣ URI Versioning

#### 🌐 Syntax Examples:

- `/v1/users`
- `/v2/orders`

#### ✅ Why Use URI Versioning?

- **Transparency:** API consumers can easily distinguish between different versions directly from the URL.
- **Caching Efficiency:** Ideal for web caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) due to predictable URLs.
- **Streamlined Routing:** Simplifies routing configurations, especially in RESTful architectures.

#### ❌ Challenges of URI Versioning:

- **Code Duplication:** Maintaining multiple versions might lead to repetitive codebases.
- **URL Clutter:** Over time, managing numerous versioned endpoints can become cumbersome.

#### 💻 Code Example: URI Versioning in Express.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/v1/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
});

app.get("/v2/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

### 2️⃣ Query Parameter Versioning

#### 🌟 Example Usage:

- `/api/users?version=1`
- `/api/users?version=2`

#### ✅ Advantages and Considerations:

- **Frontend Flexibility:** No changes required in the endpoint structure, making it easier for frontend teams.
- **Unified Endpoint Management:** Supports multiple versions under a single endpoint.
- **Caching Drawback:** Query parameters may not be optimally cached by certain CDNs.

#### 💻 Code Example: Query Parameter Versioning

```javascript
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  const { version } = req.query;
  if (version === "1") {
    res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
  } else if (version === "2") {
    res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
  } else {
    res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid API version" });
  }
});
```

### 3️⃣ Header Versioning

#### 🏷 Practical Example:

- `Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json`
- `Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v2+json`

#### ✅ Why Consider Header Versioning?

- **URL Cleanliness:** Keeps endpoints free from version identifiers.
- **Scalable for Large APIs:** Particularly suitable for microservices and complex enterprise architectures.

#### 💻 Code Example: Header Versioning in Express.js

```javascript
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  const version = req.headers["accept"];
  if (version.includes("vnd.myapp.v1")) {
    res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
  } else if (version.includes("vnd.myapp.v2")) {
    res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
  } else {
    res.status(400).json({ error: "Unsupported API version" });
  }
});
```

### 4️⃣ Content Negotiation

#### 📦 Understanding Content Negotiation:

- Clients define desired versions via `Accept` headers or MIME types.
- The server dynamically delivers the corresponding version.

#### ✅ Key Benefits:

- **Adaptive Version Management:** Easily accommodates evolving APIs without breaking existing clients.
- **Highly Flexible:** Ideal for applications that require dynamic data formats.

#### 💻 Code Example: Content Negotiation in NestJS

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Req, Res } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Request, Response } from "express";

@Controller("users")
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  getUsers(@Req() req: Request, @Res() res: Response) {
    const acceptHeader = req.headers["accept"];
    if (acceptHeader.includes("vnd.myapp.v1+json")) {
      res.json({ version: "v1", users: ["Alice", "Bob"] });
    } else if (acceptHeader.includes("vnd.myapp.v2+json")) {
      res.json({ version: "v2", users: ["Charlie", "Dave", "Eva"] });
    } else {
      res.status(400).json({ error: "Unsupported API version" });
    }
  }
}
```

### 🎯 Choosing the Right Versioning Strategy

When selecting an API versioning approach, developers must consider:

- **Project Scale:** Public APIs benefit from URI versioning for transparency.
