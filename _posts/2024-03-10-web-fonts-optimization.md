# Web Boost - 10: Web Fonts Optimization

## Introduction

In the vast landscape of web development, **web performance** optimization remains a top priority, and rightly so. The speed and efficiency with which a website loads its content directly impact user engagement, retention, and overall satisfaction. One critical yet often overlooked aspect of this optimization is **font loading**. Fonts, though seemingly trivial, can significantly affect the perceived and actual load time of a webpage.

Fonts are essential for the aesthetic appeal and readability of a website, but they can also be a bottleneck if not managed correctly. When a browser encounters a font file that it needs to download, it can halt the rendering process, leading to noticeable delays in content visibility. This is where understanding different **font loading strategies** becomes crucial.

### The Role of Font Loading in Web Performance

Font loading strategies like **Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT)**, **Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT)**, and **Flash of Faux Text (FOFT)** directly address the issue of how fonts are displayed during the loading process:

- **FOIT**: The text remains invisible until the font is fully loaded. This can lead to a poor user experience as content appears all at once, which might be delayed.

- **FOUT**: Text is immediately shown in a fallback or system font and then swapped out with the intended font once it's loaded. This approach is generally preferred as it shows textual content without delay, albeit briefly in an unstyled font.

- **FOFT**: A refined version of FOUT where only a small subset of the font is loaded initially to cover visible text, followed by the rest of the font. This method combines fast rendering with styled text, optimizing both performance and aesthetics.

### Subsetting Fonts to Reduce Load Time

Another effective technique to enhance font loading is **subsetting**, which involves including only the characters that are actually used on the website in the font file. This significantly reduces the size of font files, ensuring quicker load times.

### Efficient Font Display Techniques

Utilizing CSS properties such as `font-display` can also dictate how fonts are handled in the browser. This property allows developers to specify how and when a font should be displayed based on the loading process, balancing between performance and visual fidelity.

In the following sections, we will dive deeper into each of these strategies, providing practical examples and code snippets to illustrate how to implement them effectively. This guide aims to empower developers to make informed decisions about font loading, aligning it with broader web performance optimization goals.

## Font Loading Strategies: FOIT, FOUT, FOFT

In the realm of web performance, how text is rendered as fonts load is not just a matter of functionality—it significantly impacts user experience. The strategies around font loading, namely **Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT)**, **Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT)**, and **Flash of Faux Text (FOFT)**, provide different ways to handle how fonts are displayed as they load. Each has its nuances and effects on how content is perceived by users, making the choice of strategy crucial depending on the context of use.

### Explaining FOIT, FOUT, and FOFT

- **FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)**:

  FOIT occurs when text remains completely invisible until the custom fonts are fully downloaded. This approach can lead to a significant delay in text visibility, especially on slow networks, potentially causing users to perceive the page as slower than it actually is.

  ```css
  /* Example CSS to avoid FOIT */
  .font-loading {
    font-display: block; /* This keeps text invisible during load, leading to FOIT */
  }
  ```

- **FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)**:

  FOUT allows text to be displayed immediately in a fallback or system font, then updates it to the desired font once it's available. This strategy improves the perceived load time since users see text right away, though it may briefly appear in a different style.

  ```css
  /* Example CSS to implement FOUT */
  .font-loading {
    font-display: swap; /* This enables FOUT by quickly swapping from fallback to custom font */
  }
  ```

- **FOFT (Flash of Faux Text)**:

  FOFT is a sophisticated approach where only a subset of the font (such as weights used for visible text) is loaded initially. The rest of the font loads subsequently, which can enhance performance without compromising the stylistic integrity of the webpage.

  ```css
  /* Example CSS to utilize a FOFT strategy */
  @font-face {
    font-family: "CustomFont";
    src: url("custom-font-subset.woff2") format("woff2");
    unicode-range: U+26; /* Subset limited to specific characters */
  }
  ```

### Impact on User Experience

Each of these strategies has a distinct impact on how users interact with and perceive a webpage:

- **FOIT** might discourage users due to apparent unresponsiveness, as they see nothing until the font loads.

- **FOUT** provides immediate content availability, which is crucial for maintaining user engagement despite the initial stylistic inconsistency.

- **FOFT** offers a balanced solution, delivering styled text quickly and filling in additional style nuances as more of the font becomes available.

### Best Practices for Font Loading

The choice among FOIT, FOUT, and FOFT largely depends on the specific needs of the web application and its audience:

- **Content-heavy sites**, such as blogs and news platforms, benefit from **FOUT** or **FOFT** to ensure text is visible as soon as possible.

- **Brand-centric sites** where style is crucial might prefer **FOIT** to maintain a consistent visual identity, though this should be used sparingly due to its impact on perceived performance.

- **FOFT** is particularly useful in scenarios where minimal text uses a unique font that is critical to the brand's presentation.

In conclusion, while choosing a font loading strategy, it's essential to consider both the aesthetic requirements and the performance implications to strike the right balance. This ensures that the site remains both fast and visually engaging.

## Subsetting Fonts to Reduce Sizes

When optimizing web fonts, one effective technique is **font subsetting**. This approach involves including only the necessary characters in a font file, significantly reducing its size. This can lead to faster loading times and less bandwidth consumption, both critical for enhancing web performance.

### What is Font Subsetting?

Font subsetting is the process of creating a smaller font file by including only the glyphs that are actually used on a website. For example, if your website's content only uses the Roman alphabet plus a handful of punctuation marks, you can subset a font to include only those characters, omitting all others.

```html
<!-- Example of a web page that might benefit from subsetting -->
<p>Hello, world! This page only uses simple English text.</p>
```

### Tools and Techniques for Font Subsetting

Several tools can facilitate font subsetting, ranging from desktop applications to online services:

- **FontForge**: A free, open-source font editor that supports subsetting. FontForge allows users to manually choose which glyphs to include in the final font file.

- **Online subsetting utilities**: Tools like Font Squirrel’s Webfont Generator or Google Fonts provide options to select specific subsets when downloading fonts, such as Latin, Cyrillic, or Greek characters.

Here's a basic example of how to subset a font using an online tool:

1. **Choose the Font**: Select the font you want to subset.

2. **Select the Characters**: Specify the characters your website needs (e.g., standard ASCII set, numbers, specific icons).

3. **Generate the Subset**: The tool will create a new, smaller font file containing only the selected characters.

### Implementation Tips

Implementing font subsetting effectively requires a balance between performance gains and potential pitfalls like missing glyphs. Here’s how you can implement it:

1. **Analyze Your Content**: Review your website to understand which characters are actually needed. Tools like Chrome’s DevTools can help you track which glyphs are used.

2. **Create the Subset**: Use a subsetting tool to create your font files. Be sure to include characters for all content visible to users, including hidden or dynamically loaded text.

3. **Fallbacks**: Ensure there are fallback fonts in your CSS in case some unexpected characters need to be displayed, which aren't included in your subset.

4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the subsetted fonts across different browsers and devices to ensure no characters are missing and the text displays correctly.

```css
/* Example CSS for implementing subsetted fonts with a fallback */
@font-face {
  font-family: "CustomFont";
  src: url("custom-font-subset.woff2") format("woff2");
  unicode-range: U+0020-007F; /* Subset for basic Latin characters */
}

body {
  font-family: "CustomFont", Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

Subsetting fonts is a potent strategy for optimizing font delivery on the web. By including only the necessary glyphs, you can significantly reduce the size of font files, improving load times and enhancing the overall user experience. However, careful consideration and testing are essential to avoid issues with missing characters and to ensure compatibility across different user environments.
