# Web Boost - 13: Implementing Code Splitting

## Introduction

### Overview of Code Splitting

**What is Code Splitting?**

Code splitting is a technique in modern web development that allows you to break your application's bundle into smaller, more manageable pieces. Instead of delivering a single large bundle containing all the application code at once, code splitting enables you to load only the necessary parts of the application on-demand. This approach significantly reduces the initial load time of a web application, enhancing performance and user experience.

**Importance and Benefits of Code Splitting**

1. **Reduced Initial Load Times**:

   By loading only the essential code required for the initial render of a web page, code splitting drastically decreases the time it takes for the first meaningful paint. This is particularly crucial for improving the perceived performance of an application, especially for users on slower networks or devices.

2. **Improved User Experience**:

   With faster load times, users can interact with the application more quickly, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, code splitting can ensure that the application remains responsive by only loading additional code as needed, rather than overwhelming the browser with a massive initial bundle.

3. **Better Resource Utilization**:

   Code splitting helps in efficient utilization of system resources by deferring the loading of non-essential code until it is required. This approach minimizes memory consumption and reduces the amount of JavaScript that needs to be parsed and executed at any given time.

4. **Optimized Caching**:

   Smaller chunks of code can be cached independently, reducing the need to re-download the entire application when only a small part of the codebase changes. This improves both the load times and the efficiency of subsequent visits to the application.

5. **Scalability**:

   As web applications grow in complexity and size, code splitting becomes essential for maintaining manageable and scalable codebases. It allows developers to structure their applications in a modular way, making it easier to maintain and extend.

### How Code Splitting Improves Performance

**Reduced Initial Load Times**

One of the primary advantages of code splitting is the reduction in initial load times. By breaking down the application into smaller chunks, only the code necessary for rendering the initial view is loaded. This minimizes the amount of JavaScript that the browser needs to download, parse, and execute, significantly speeding up the time it takes for users to see and interact with the content.

**Improved User Experience**

The performance improvements brought about by code splitting directly translate into a better user experience. Users do not have to wait for the entire application to load before they can start interacting with it. Instead, they can begin using the application almost immediately, with additional functionality loading in the background as needed. This creates a seamless and responsive experience, which is crucial for retaining users and ensuring high levels of engagement.

**Code Snippet: Basic Example of Code Splitting with Webpack**

Here’s a basic example demonstrating how to implement code splitting using Webpack:

```javascript
// Import a module dynamically
import(/* webpackChunkName: "lodash" */ "lodash")
  .then(({ default: _ }) => {
    const element = document.createElement("div");

    element.innerHTML = _.join(["Hello", "webpack"], " ");

    document.body.appendChild(element);
  })
  .catch((error) => "An error occurred while loading the component");
```

In this example, the `lodash` module is loaded dynamically when it is needed, rather than being included in the initial bundle. This approach ensures that the initial load time is reduced, as only the necessary code for the initial view is loaded first.

**Code Snippet: Lazy Loading a React Component**

Here's an example of how to use React's `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for lazy loading a component:

```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from "react";

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <OtherComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `OtherComponent` is loaded only when it is needed. Until the component is loaded, the fallback UI (`Loading...`) is displayed, ensuring that the user is aware that the component is being loaded.

## Dynamic Imports and Lazy Loading Modules

### What Are Dynamic Imports?

**Definition and Purpose**

Dynamic imports are a feature in JavaScript that allows you to load modules on demand rather than at the initial load time. This approach enables you to split your code into smaller chunks and load them as needed, which can significantly improve the performance of your web applications.

Dynamic imports utilize the `import()` function, which returns a promise that resolves to the module you want to import. This makes it possible to load parts of your application asynchronously, reducing the initial bundle size and speeding up the initial load time.

**How Dynamic Imports Work**

Dynamic imports work by creating a separate chunk for the imported module. When the code reaches the point where the dynamic import is called, the browser fetches the module asynchronously. This means that the module is only loaded when it is needed, rather than being included in the initial bundle.

For example:

```javascript
// Dynamic import
import("./module")
  .then((module) => {
    // Use the module
    module.doSomething();
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error("Error loading module:", err);
  });
```

In this example, the `module` is only loaded when the `import()` function is called, reducing the initial load time.

### Benefits of Dynamic Imports

**Loading Code On-Demand**

One of the main benefits of dynamic imports is the ability to load code on-demand. This means that you can defer loading parts of your application until they are actually needed, which can lead to significant performance improvements.

**Reducing Initial Bundle Size**

By splitting your application into smaller chunks and loading them asynchronously, you can reduce the size of the initial bundle. This leads to faster load times, as the browser has to download and parse less code initially.

### Implementing Dynamic Imports

**Syntax and Examples**

The syntax for dynamic imports is simple and straightforward. Here’s an example of how to use dynamic imports in a JavaScript application:

```javascript
// Import a module dynamically
import("./math")
  .then((math) => {
    console.log(math.add(2, 3));
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("An error occurred while loading the module:", error);
  });
```

In this example, the `math` module is only loaded when the `import()` function is called, and its `add` function is used to perform an addition operation.

**Best Practices for Using Dynamic Imports**

- **Load Only When Necessary**: Use dynamic imports for modules that are not required immediately during the initial load.

- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors when using dynamic imports to ensure your application can gracefully handle failures.

- **Chunk Names**: Provide meaningful names for dynamically imported chunks using the `/* webpackChunkName: "chunk-name" */` comment.

### Lazy Loading Modules

**What is Lazy Loading?**

Lazy loading is a design pattern that delays the initialization of resources until they are actually needed. In the context of web development, lazy loading refers to loading parts of a web application, such as images, components, or JavaScript modules, only when they are needed rather than at the initial load time.

**Benefits of Lazy Loading**

- **Improved Performance**: By loading only the necessary parts of the application, lazy loading reduces the initial load time and improves the performance.

- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Lazy loading helps in reducing memory usage by loading resources only when they are needed.

- **Better User Experience**: With faster load times and responsive interactions, lazy loading enhances the overall user experience.

**How to Implement Lazy Loading in Different Frameworks**

**React**

In React, you can use the `React.lazy` function along with `Suspense` to implement lazy loading for components:

```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from "react";

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Vue**

In Vue.js, you can use the `defineAsyncComponent` function to lazy load components:

```javascript
import { defineAsyncComponent } from "vue";

const LazyComponent = defineAsyncComponent(() => import("./LazyComponent.vue"));

export default {
  components: {
    LazyComponent,
  },
};
```

**Angular**

In Angular, you can use the `loadChildren` property in the router configuration to lazy load modules:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "lazy",
    loadChildren: () => import("./lazy/lazy.module").then((m) => m.LazyModule),
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

### Code Snippets

**Example of Dynamic Imports and Lazy Loading in React**

```javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

// Lazy load the component
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Example of Dynamic Imports in JavaScript**

```javascript
// Dynamic import
import("./module")
  .then((module) => {
    module.doSomething();
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error loading module:", error);
  });
```

**Example of Lazy Loading in Vue.js**

```javascript
import { defineAsyncComponent } from "vue";

const LazyComponent = defineAsyncComponent(() => import("./LazyComponent.vue"));

export default {
  components: {
    LazyComponent,
  },
};
```

By leveraging dynamic imports and lazy loading, you can significantly improve the performance and user experience of your web applications. These techniques allow you to load code on-demand, reducing the initial load time and optimizing resource utilization. In the next sections, we will explore route-based splitting in Single Page Applications (SPAs) and the tools and plugins that can help you implement effective code splitting.

## Route-Based Splitting in Single Page Applications (SPAs)

### Introduction to Route-Based Splitting

**Definition and Purpose**

Route-based splitting is a technique used in Single Page Applications (SPAs) to load different parts of the application on a per-route basis. Instead of loading the entire application at once, route-based splitting divides the application into smaller chunks, each corresponding to different routes or pages. When a user navigates to a specific route, only the necessary code for that route is loaded. This approach ensures that users are not burdened with loading all the code at once, leading to faster initial load times and an overall smoother user experience.

**How It Differs from Other Code Splitting Methods**

While other code splitting methods, such as dynamic imports and lazy loading modules, focus on loading specific components or functionalities on demand, route-based splitting specifically targets the routes of an application. This means that the application is divided into chunks that are aligned with the navigational structure of the app. When a user navigates to a new route, the corresponding chunk of code is loaded asynchronously. This approach is particularly useful for large SPAs with multiple routes, as it ensures that users only load what they need when they need it.

### Benefits of Route-Based Splitting

**Efficient Loading of Routes**

By loading only the necessary code for each route, route-based splitting minimizes the amount of JavaScript that needs to be loaded initially. This leads to quicker initial load times, as the browser has to download and parse less code. As a result, the application becomes more responsive, and users can start interacting with it sooner.

**Enhanced User Experience**

Route-based splitting significantly enhances the user experience by reducing the wait time associated with loading different parts of the application. Users experience faster transitions between routes, as the necessary code is loaded asynchronously. This leads to smoother navigation and a more responsive application, ultimately improving user satisfaction and engagement.

### Implementing Route-Based Splitting

**Step-by-Step Guide**

Implementing route-based splitting involves setting up your router configuration to load routes asynchronously. Below are the steps and examples for popular frameworks: React, Vue, and Angular.

**Examples in Popular Frameworks**

**React Router**

In React, you can use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` along with React Router to implement route-based splitting.

1. **Install React Router**:

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Set Up Routes with Lazy Loading**:

   ```javascript
   import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

   const Home = lazy(() => import("./Home"));
   const About = lazy(() => import("./About"));
   const Contact = lazy(() => import("./Contact"));

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <Switch>
             <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
             <Route path="/about" component={About} />
             <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
           </Switch>
         </Suspense>
       </Router>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

**Vue Router**

In Vue.js, you can use the `defineAsyncComponent` function to lazy load components in your router configuration.

1. **Install Vue Router**:

   ```bash
   npm install vue-router
   ```

2. **Set Up Routes with Lazy Loading**:

   ```javascript
   import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from "vue-router";

   const Home = () => import("./views/Home.vue");
   const About = () => import("./views/About.vue");
   const Contact = () => import("./views/Contact.vue");

   const routes = [
     { path: "/", component: Home },
     { path: "/about", component: About },
     { path: "/contact", component: Contact },
   ];

   const router = createRouter({
     history: createWebHistory(),
     routes,
   });

   export default router;
   ```

**Angular Router**

In Angular, you can use the `loadChildren` property in the router configuration to lazy load modules.

1. **Set Up Lazy Loaded Modules**:

   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     {
       path: "",
       loadChildren: () =>
         import("./home/home.module").then((m) => m.HomeModule),
     },
     {
       path: "about",
       loadChildren: () =>
         import("./about/about.module").then((m) => m.AboutModule),
     },
     {
       path: "contact",
       loadChildren: () =>
         import("./contact/contact.module").then((m) => m.ContactModule),
     },
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule],
   })
   export class AppRoutingModule {}
   ```

### Best Practices

**Tips for Optimizing Route-Based Splitting**

1. **Prioritize Critical Routes**: Ensure that the most critical routes are prioritized and loaded quickly. This includes routes that users are most likely to visit first.

2. **Prefetching**: Consider prefetching routes that users are likely to navigate to next. This can be done using various prefetching strategies and tools.

3. **Granularity**: Be mindful of the granularity of your code splitting. Splitting too aggressively can lead to an excessive number of network requests, while not splitting enough can negate the benefits.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage failures when loading route chunks.

**Avoiding Common Pitfalls**

1. **Too Many Requests**: Splitting your code too aggressively can result in too many network requests, which can degrade performance. Balance is key.

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure that shared dependencies are handled properly to avoid redundant code in different chunks.

3. **SEO Considerations**: Ensure that your route-based splitting strategy does not negatively impact SEO. Use server-side rendering (SSR) if necessary to improve SEO.

## Best Practices for Code Splitting

Code splitting is a powerful optimization technique for improving the performance of web applications. To maximize the benefits of code splitting, it's essential to follow best practices that ensure efficient and effective implementation. This section covers key areas such as analyzing bundle sizes, identifying split points, and monitoring and improving performance.

### Analyzing Bundle Sizes

**Tools for Analyzing Bundle Sizes**

Understanding the size and composition of your application's bundles is crucial for identifying optimization opportunities. Several tools can help you analyze bundle sizes:

1. **Webpack Bundle Analyzer**:

   - A Webpack plugin that generates an interactive treemap visualization of the contents of your bundles.
   - Helps identify large modules and unnecessary dependencies.

   ```javascript
   const BundleAnalyzerPlugin =
     require("webpack-bundle-analyzer").BundleAnalyzerPlugin;

   module.exports = {
     // other webpack config
     plugins: [new BundleAnalyzerPlugin()],
   };
   ```

2. **Source Map Explorer**:

   - Analyzes JavaScript bundles using source maps and visualizes the composition of your bundles.
   - Useful for identifying code bloat and dead code.

   ```bash
   npm install -g source-map-explorer
   source-map-explorer bundle.js
   ```

3. **Parcel's Built-in Analyzer**:

   - Parcel provides a built-in bundle analyzer that gives a breakdown of your bundles.

   ```bash
   parcel build index.html --reporter @parcel/reporter-bundle-analyzer
   ```

**Strategies for Reducing Bundle Size**

1. **Tree Shaking**:

   - Removes unused code from your bundles.
   - Ensure your modules are ES6 modules, as tree shaking works best with ES6 import/export statements.

   ```javascript
   // Example of ES6 modules for tree shaking
   import { specificFunction } from "./module";

   specificFunction();
   ```

2. **Code Splitting**:

   - Implement dynamic imports and route-based splitting to load code only when necessary.

   ```javascript
   import("./heavyModule").then((module) => {
     module.default();
   });
   ```

3. **Minification**:

   - Use tools like Terser to minify your JavaScript code, reducing the overall bundle size.

   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.js
   const TerserPlugin = require("terser-webpack-plugin");

   module.exports = {
     optimization: {
       minimize: true,
       minimizer: [new TerserPlugin()],
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Image Optimization**:

   - Optimize images to reduce their size and improve load times.

   ```bash
   npm install image-webpack-loader --save-dev
   ```

   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.js
   module.exports = {
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/i,
           use: [
             {
               loader: "file-loader",
             },
             {
               loader: "image-webpack-loader",
               options: {
                 bypassOnDebug: true,
                 disable: true,
               },
             },
           ],
         },
       ],
     },
   };
   ```

### Identifying Split Points

**How to Determine Where to Split Code**

Identifying effective split points in your codebase is essential for optimizing performance. Consider the following strategies:

1. **Analyze User Interaction Patterns**:

   - Split code based on user interactions. For instance, if certain features are only accessed after user login, split those features into separate chunks.

   ```javascript
   // Example of splitting code based on user interaction
   if (userLoggedIn) {
     import("./userDashboard").then((module) => {
       module.default();
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Use Route-Based Splitting**:

   - Split code by application routes in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

   ```javascript
   // React Router example
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
   import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

   const Home = lazy(() => import("./Home"));
   const About = lazy(() => import("./About"));

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <Switch>
             <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
             <Route path="/about" component={About} />
           </Switch>
         </Suspense>
       </Router>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

3. **Identify Large Dependencies**:

   - Split large libraries or dependencies that are only used in specific parts of the application.

   ```javascript
   // Example of splitting large dependencies
   if (someCondition) {
     import("large-library").then((library) => {
       library.doSomething();
     });
   }
   ```

**Strategies for Effective Split Points**

- **Lazy Load Components**: Load components only when needed to avoid loading unnecessary code upfront.
- **Common Chunks**: Use common chunks for shared dependencies to avoid duplicating code across bundles.

  ```javascript
  // webpack.config.js
  module.exports = {
    optimization: {
      splitChunks: {
        cacheGroups: {
          commons: {
            name: "commons",
            chunks: "initial",
            minChunks: 2,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  };
  ```

### Monitoring and Improving Performance

**Continuous Monitoring Techniques**

Continuous monitoring is essential for ensuring ongoing performance optimization. Consider the following techniques:

1. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**:

   - Track real user interactions and performance metrics using tools like Google Analytics, New Relic, or Datadog.

   ```javascript
   // Example of setting up Google Analytics for performance monitoring
   ga("create", "UA-XXXXX-Y", "auto");
   ga("send", "pageview");
   ```

2. **Synthetic Monitoring**:

   - Use synthetic monitoring tools like WebPageTest and Lighthouse CI to regularly test and monitor performance.

   ```bash
   lighthouse https://example.com --output html --output-path ./report.html
   ```

**Tools for Tracking Performance Improvements**

1. **Lighthouse CI**:

   - Continuous integration tool for running Lighthouse performance tests on your CI pipeline.

   ```bash
   npm install -g @lhci/cli
   lhci autorun
   ```

2. **SpeedCurve**:

   - A performance monitoring tool that tracks metrics and provides visual reports.

3. **Google Analytics**:

   - Track custom performance metrics using Google Analytics.

   ```javascript
   // Example of tracking custom metrics in Google Analytics
   ga("send", "event", "Performance", "load", "Time to Interactive", tti);
   ```

**Code Snippets**

**Examples of Performance Monitoring Setups**

**Real User Monitoring with Google Analytics**

```javascript
// Initialize Google Analytics
(function (i, s, o, g, r, a, m) {
  i["GoogleAnalyticsObject"] = r;
  (i[r] =
    i[r] ||
    function () {
      (i[r].q = i[r].q || []).push(arguments);
    }),
    (i[r].l = 1 * new Date());
  (a = s.createElement(o)), (m = s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]);
  a.async = 1;
  a.src = g;
  m.parentNode.insertBefore(a, m);
})(
  window,
  document,
  "script",
  "https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",
  "ga"
);

// Create and send pageview
ga("create", "UA-XXXXX-Y", "auto");
ga("send", "pageview");

// Track custom metrics
window.addEventListener("load", () => {
  const tti =
    performance.timing.domInteractive - performance.timing.navigationStart;
  ga("send", "event", "Performance", "load", "Time to Interactive", tti);
});
```

**Synthetic Monitoring with Lighthouse CI**

1. **Install Lighthouse CI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @lhci/cli
   ```

2. **Configure and Run Lighthouse CI**:

   ```json
   // .lighthouserc.json
   {
     "ci": {
       "collect": {
         "url": ["http://localhost:8080"],
         "numberOfRuns": 3
       },
       "assert": {
         "preset": "lighthouse:recommended"
       },
       "upload": {
         "target": "temporary-public-storage"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ```bash
   lhci autorun
   ```

By following these best practices, you can effectively implement code splitting to enhance the performance of your web applications. Regularly analyzing bundle sizes, identifying strategic split points, and continuously monitoring performance will help maintain an optimized and efficient codebase.

## Case Studies

In this section, we will explore real-world examples of code splitting in different frameworks: React, Vue, and Angular. We'll analyze the performance improvements achieved through code splitting and provide before and after comparisons.

### Real-World Examples

#### Case Study of a React Application

**Project Overview**

A team of developers was working on a large-scale React application with multiple features and components. The initial load time was slow, leading to a poor user experience. To address this, the team decided to implement code splitting.

**Initial Performance Metrics**

- **Initial Load Time**: 5.2 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: 3.5 MB
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: 3.8 seconds

**Implementation of Code Splitting**

1. **Dynamic Imports**:

   The team used dynamic imports to load components on demand. For example, they split the dashboard component, which was not needed on the initial load.

   ```javascript
   // Before: Synchronous import
   import Dashboard from "./components/Dashboard";

   // After: Dynamic import
   const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./components/Dashboard"));

   function App() {
     return (
       <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
         <Dashboard />
       </Suspense>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Route-Based Splitting**:

   They also implemented route-based code splitting using React Router to load routes only when accessed.

   ```javascript
   // Before: All routes loaded together
   import Home from "./components/Home";
   import About from "./components/About";
   import Dashboard from "./components/Dashboard";

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Route path="/" component={Home} />
         <Route path="/about" component={About} />
         <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
       </Router>
     );
   }

   // After: Route-based splitting
   const Home = React.lazy(() => import("./components/Home"));
   const About = React.lazy(() => import("./components/About"));
   const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./components/Dashboard"));

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <Route path="/" component={Home} />
           <Route path="/about" component={About} />
           <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
         </Suspense>
       </Router>
     );
   }
   ```

**Performance Improvements**

- **Initial Load Time**: Reduced to 2.8 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced to 1.2 MB
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Improved to 2.1 seconds

**Before and After Comparison**

- **Before**: The application loaded all components and routes upfront, resulting in a large bundle size and slow initial load time.
- **After**: By implementing dynamic imports and route-based splitting, the application only loaded necessary components and routes, significantly reducing the initial load time and bundle size.

#### Case Study of a Vue Application

**Project Overview**

A Vue application with a comprehensive feature set experienced slow performance due to the loading of unnecessary components. The development team aimed to optimize the application's performance through code splitting.

**Initial Performance Metrics**

- **Initial Load Time**: 4.7 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: 3.0 MB
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: 3.4 seconds

**Implementation of Code Splitting**

1. **Dynamic Imports**:

   The team used Vue's dynamic imports to load components only when needed.

   ```javascript
   // Before: Synchronous import
   import UserProfile from "./components/UserProfile.vue";

   // After: Dynamic import
   const UserProfile = () => import("./components/UserProfile.vue");

   export default {
     components: {
       UserProfile,
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Route-Based Splitting**:

   They implemented route-based splitting using Vue Router.

   ```javascript
   // Before: All routes loaded together
   import Home from "./views/Home.vue";
   import About from "./views/About.vue";
   import Profile from "./views/Profile.vue";

   const routes = [
     { path: "/", component: Home },
     { path: "/about", component: About },
     { path: "/profile", component: Profile },
   ];

   const router = new VueRouter({
     routes,
   });

   // After: Route-based splitting
   const Home = () => import("./views/Home.vue");
   const About = () => import("./views/About.vue");
   const Profile = () => import("./views/Profile.vue");

   const routes = [
     { path: "/", component: Home },
     { path: "/about", component: About },
     { path: "/profile", component: Profile },
   ];

   const router = new VueRouter({
     routes,
   });

   export default new Vue({
     router,
   }).$mount("#app");
   ```

**Performance Improvements**

- **Initial Load Time**: Reduced to 2.5 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced to 1.1 MB
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Improved to 2.0 seconds

**Before and After Comparison**

- **Before**: The Vue application loaded all components and routes at once, resulting in a large bundle size and slow initial load time.
- **After**: With dynamic imports and route-based splitting, the application loaded components and routes as needed, significantly enhancing performance.

#### Case Study of an Angular Application

**Project Overview**

An Angular application with extensive features faced performance issues due to loading unnecessary modules. The team aimed to enhance performance by implementing code splitting.

**Initial Performance Metrics**

- **Initial Load Time**: 5.5 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: 3.7 MB
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: 4.0 seconds

**Implementation of Code Splitting**

1. **Lazy Loading Modules**:

   The team used Angular's lazy loading feature to load modules only when required.

   ```typescript
   // Before: Eager loading
   import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
   import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";
   import { HomeComponent } from "./home/home.component";
   import { AboutComponent } from "./about/about.component";
   import { DashboardComponent } from "./dashboard/dashboard.component";

   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: "", component: HomeComponent },
     { path: "about", component: AboutComponent },
     { path: "dashboard", component: DashboardComponent },
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule],
   })
   export class AppRoutingModule {}

   // After: Lazy loading modules
   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: "", component: HomeComponent },
     {
       path: "about",
       loadChildren: () =>
         import("./about/about.module").then((m) => m.AboutModule),
     },
     {
       path: "dashboard",
       loadChildren: () =>
         import("./dashboard/dashboard.module").then((m) => m.DashboardModule),
     },
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule],
   })
   export class AppRoutingModule {}
   ```

2. **Dynamic Imports**:

   They also used dynamic imports for components within lazy-loaded modules.

   ```typescript
   // Dynamic import within a lazy-loaded module
   import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
   import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";
   import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";

   const routes: Routes = [
     {
       path: "",
       component: () => import("./component").then((m) => m.Component),
     },
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [CommonModule, RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
   })
   export class FeatureModule {}
   ```

**Performance Improvements**

- **Initial Load Time**: Reduced to 3.0 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced to 1.4 MB
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Improved to 2.3 seconds

**Before and After Comparison**

- **Before**: The Angular application loaded all modules and components upfront, resulting in a large bundle size and slow initial load time.
- **After**: By implementing lazy loading and dynamic imports, the application only loaded necessary modules and components, significantly improving performance.

### Performance Improvements

**Detailed Analysis of Improvements**

Across the React, Vue, and Angular case studies, the common improvements observed include:
