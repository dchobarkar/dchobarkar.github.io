# Web Boost - 13: Implementing Code Splitting

## Introduction

### Overview of Code Splitting

**What is Code Splitting?**

Code splitting is a technique in modern web development that allows you to break your application's bundle into smaller, more manageable pieces. Instead of delivering a single large bundle containing all the application code at once, code splitting enables you to load only the necessary parts of the application on-demand. This approach significantly reduces the initial load time of a web application, enhancing performance and user experience.

**Importance and Benefits of Code Splitting**

1. **Reduced Initial Load Times**:

   By loading only the essential code required for the initial render of a web page, code splitting drastically decreases the time it takes for the first meaningful paint. This is particularly crucial for improving the perceived performance of an application, especially for users on slower networks or devices.

2. **Improved User Experience**:

   With faster load times, users can interact with the application more quickly, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, code splitting can ensure that the application remains responsive by only loading additional code as needed, rather than overwhelming the browser with a massive initial bundle.

3. **Better Resource Utilization**:

   Code splitting helps in efficient utilization of system resources by deferring the loading of non-essential code until it is required. This approach minimizes memory consumption and reduces the amount of JavaScript that needs to be parsed and executed at any given time.

4. **Optimized Caching**:

   Smaller chunks of code can be cached independently, reducing the need to re-download the entire application when only a small part of the codebase changes. This improves both the load times and the efficiency of subsequent visits to the application.

5. **Scalability**:

   As web applications grow in complexity and size, code splitting becomes essential for maintaining manageable and scalable codebases. It allows developers to structure their applications in a modular way, making it easier to maintain and extend.

### How Code Splitting Improves Performance

**Reduced Initial Load Times**

One of the primary advantages of code splitting is the reduction in initial load times. By breaking down the application into smaller chunks, only the code necessary for rendering the initial view is loaded. This minimizes the amount of JavaScript that the browser needs to download, parse, and execute, significantly speeding up the time it takes for users to see and interact with the content.

**Improved User Experience**

The performance improvements brought about by code splitting directly translate into a better user experience. Users do not have to wait for the entire application to load before they can start interacting with it. Instead, they can begin using the application almost immediately, with additional functionality loading in the background as needed. This creates a seamless and responsive experience, which is crucial for retaining users and ensuring high levels of engagement.

**Code Snippet: Basic Example of Code Splitting with Webpack**

Hereâ€™s a basic example demonstrating how to implement code splitting using Webpack:

```javascript
// Import a module dynamically
import(/* webpackChunkName: "lodash" */ "lodash")
  .then(({ default: _ }) => {
    const element = document.createElement("div");

    element.innerHTML = _.join(["Hello", "webpack"], " ");

    document.body.appendChild(element);
  })
  .catch((error) => "An error occurred while loading the component");
```

In this example, the `lodash` module is loaded dynamically when it is needed, rather than being included in the initial bundle. This approach ensures that the initial load time is reduced, as only the necessary code for the initial view is loaded first.

**Code Snippet: Lazy Loading a React Component**

Here's an example of how to use React's `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for lazy loading a component:

```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from "react";

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <OtherComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `OtherComponent` is loaded only when it is needed. Until the component is loaded, the fallback UI (`Loading...`) is displayed, ensuring that the user is aware that the component is being loaded.
