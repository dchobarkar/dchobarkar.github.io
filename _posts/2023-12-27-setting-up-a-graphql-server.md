# GraphQL - 02: Setting Up a GraphQL Server: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction to Setting Up a GraphQL Server with Node.js and Express

In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, GraphQL stands out as a revolutionary data querying language that has significantly altered how developers interact with databases and APIs. Developed by Facebook in 2015, GraphQL provides a powerful, efficient, and flexible alternative to the traditional REST API architecture, enabling developers to precisely request the data they need and nothing more. This capability not only simplifies data retrieval processes but also significantly reduces the amount of data transferred over the network, enhancing application performance.

**Objective of This Article**: This guide is designed to walk you through the process of setting up a basic GraphQL server using Node.js and Express. Whether you're a seasoned backend developer or new to server-side development, this article aims to provide you with a clear, step-by-step approach to integrating GraphQL into your web development projects, laying the foundation for more complex applications.

## Environment Setup

Before diving into the world of GraphQL, it's important to ensure that your development environment is correctly set up. This section covers the prerequisites and initial steps needed to get started with building a GraphQL server.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you'll need:

- A basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. Node.js serves as the runtime environment, while npm helps manage the packages your project depends on.

### Installing Node.js and npm

Node.js and npm are essential tools for modern web development. Here’s how to install them:

- **Windows and macOS**: Visit the official Node.js website and download the installer for your operating system. The installer includes both Node.js and npm, making setup straightforward. Follow the installation prompts to complete the setup.

- **Linux**: Depending on your distribution, you can install Node.js and npm using your package manager. For Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, you can use the following commands:

```jsx
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Verify the installation by checking the version of Node.js and npm:

```jsx
node - v;
npm - v;
```

### Initializing a Node.js Project

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can create and initialize a new Node.js project:

1. Create a New Directory: Choose a directory for your project and create it if it doesn't exist:

   ```jsx
   mkdir my-graphql-server
   cd my-graphql-server
   ```

2. **Initialize the Project**: Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file, which will keep track of the dependencies and scripts associated with your project. You can fill in the details as prompted or press Enter to accept the defaults.

   ```jsx
   npm init
   ```

   The `package.json` file is crucial as it includes metadata about your project and lists its dependencies, making it easier to manage and share your project.

## Setting Up a GraphQL Server with Node.js and Express

### Installing Express and GraphQL Dependencies

To get started with our GraphQL server, we first need to install Express — a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, along with GraphQL dependencies.

**Command Line Inputs for npm Installations**:

```jsx
npm install express graphql express-graphql
```

This command installs Express, GraphQL, and `express-graphql`, a middleware that allows Express to understand GraphQL and construct a GraphQL API.

### Creating the Server

With the necessary packages installed, the next step is to set up an Express server.

**Basic Express Server Setup**:

```jsx
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 4000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This snippet creates a simple Express server that listens on port 4000.

### Integrating GraphQL with Express

Now, let's integrate GraphQL into our Express server using the `express-graphql` middleware.

**Middleware Setup for GraphQL**:

```jsx
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
const { buildSchema } = require("graphql");

// Construct a schema using GraphQL schema language
const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`);

// The root provides a resolver function for each API endpoint
const root = {
  hello: () => {
    return "Hello, world!";
  },
};

app.use(
  "/graphql",
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema: schema,
    rootValue: root,
    graphiql: true,
  })
);
```

This code snippet sets up a basic GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` with a simple schema and resolver.

## Building a "Hello, World!" GraphQL API

### Introduction to Schemas and Resolvers

In GraphQL, **schemas** define the shape of your data and the operations you can perform, while **resolvers** are the mechanisms for fetching the data specified by queries or mutations in the schema.

### Defining the Schema

Let's define a simple GraphQL schema for a "Hello, World!" query.

**GraphQL Schema Definition for "Hello, World!"**:

```jsx
type Query {
  hello: String
}

```

This schema defines a single query named `hello` that returns a `String`.

### Writing the Resolver

Resolvers are functions that resolve the value for a type or field in the schema.

**Resolver Function for Returning "Hello, World!"**:

```jsx
const root = {
  hello: () => "Hello, world!",
};
```

This resolver function returns the string "Hello, world!" whenever the `hello` query is called.

### Bringing It All Together

Finally, let's integrate our schema and resolver with the Express server using the `express-graphql` middleware.

**Integrating the Schema and Resolver with GraphQL Middleware**:

```jsx
app.use(
  "/graphql",
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema: schema,
    rootValue: root,
    graphiql: true, // Enables the GraphiQL IDE
  })
);
```

This setup allows us to use the GraphiQL IDE at the `/graphql` endpoint for testing our API.

## Testing the GraphQL API

### Introduction to Testing Tools

Testing is an integral part of API development, ensuring reliability and performance. For GraphQL APIs, tools like GraphQL Playground and Postman provide comprehensive environments for executing queries and mutations, examining responses, and debugging.

### Using GraphQL Playground

GraphQL Playground is a powerful IDE for exploring GraphQL APIs. It offers features such as auto-completion, real-time error highlighting, and documentation.

#### Step-by-Step Guide on Testing with GraphQL Playground:

1. **Installation**: GraphQL Playground is often included automatically with GraphQL server libraries like `express-graphql`. If your setup includes `graphiql: true`, navigating to your GraphQL endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/graphql`) in a web browser should open GraphQL Playground.

2. **Executing a Query**: Enter your query on the left pane and hit the play button to execute it.

**Code Snippet: Example Query in GraphQL Playground**:

```jsx
{
  hello;
}
```

This query, when executed, should return the following response:

```jsx
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello, world!"
  }
}
```

### Alternative: Testing with Postman

Postman is another versatile tool for API testing, supporting various types of APIs, including GraphQL.

#### Setting Up a GraphQL Request in Postman:

1. **Create a New Request**: Select "POST" as the request method and enter your GraphQL server's endpoint URL.

2. **Set Headers**: Add a header with `Content-Type` set to `application/json`.

3. **Configure the Body**: Select 'raw' and input your GraphQL query within a JSON object under the `query` key.

**Code Snippet: Configuring a GraphQL Request in Postman**:

```jsx
{
  "query": "{ hello }"
}
```

Execute the request to see the response from your GraphQL server, which should match the expected output.
