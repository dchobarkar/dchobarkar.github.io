# From Web to Web3 - 06: Understanding Tokens and NFTs in Blockchain Development

## ðŸ§© Introduction

In the blockchain world, **tokens** and **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** have become the backbone of many decentralized applicationsâ€”spanning finance, gaming, art, identity, and beyond. Whether you're interacting with DeFi protocols, collecting digital art, or building play-to-earn ecosystems, you're dealing with tokens under the hood. ðŸ§ âœ¨

### ðŸ”¹ What are Tokens and NFTs in the Context of Blockchain?

At their core, **tokens** are digital representations of assets or utilities that reside on a blockchain. They can be **fungible**, like cryptocurrencies (ETH, USDC, DAI), or **non-fungible**, like a unique piece of art or a collectible card.

- **Fungible tokens** are interchangeable. One USDC is always equal to another USDC.
- **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** are **unique** digital assets with metadata that makes each one distinctâ€”think of them like digital fingerprints on the blockchain.

These tokens are not native to the blockchain itself but are governed by smart contracts that adhere to specific **token standards**â€”like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### ðŸ”§ Role of Smart Contracts in Token Creation

Smart contracts are the engine behind tokenization. They define how tokens behaveâ€”how they can be transferred, who can mint them, and what metadata they carry.

Here's a simple ERC-20 snippet written in Solidity:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract DevToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("DevToken", "DVT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```

With just a few lines of code and OpenZeppelinâ€™s battle-tested contracts, you can spin up a fully-functional fungible token! The same goes for NFTs using the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards.

### ðŸ“œ Evolution of Token Standards in Ethereum and Beyond

The Ethereum ecosystem introduced token standards to streamline how tokens are built and interacted with:

- **ERC-20**: The standard for fungible tokens. Widely used across DeFi projects.
- **ERC-721**: The pioneer standard for NFTs. Ideal for 1:1 unique items.
- **ERC-1155**: A hybrid multi-token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible assetsâ€”perfect for games and metaverse apps.

Outside Ethereum, blockchains like **Solana, Flow, and Tezos** have their own token mechanisms, but the core idea remains: **tokens are programmable assets.**

### ðŸ’¡ Why Developers Should Care: Power of Programmable Assets

Tokens and NFTs aren't just buzzwordsâ€”they're **building blocks of Web3**. For developers, they unlock new ways to:

- **Monetize applications** (via tokens or NFTs)
- **Create programmable economies** (think in-game markets or DAO governance)
- **Build on composable infrastructure** (DeFi lego blocks, NFT marketplaces, lending protocols)

This shift toward **tokenized infrastructure** means your code can now interact with **global digital economies**, opening up powerful new paradigms of value creation ðŸ’¸ðŸ”—
