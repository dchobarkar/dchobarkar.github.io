# Conversational AI: Building Intelligent Chatbots Across Platforms - 03: Hands-On: Build a Website Chatbot with OpenAI + LangChain

## 🤖 Project Overview: What We’re Building

In this tutorial, we're diving into the practical side of conversational AI by building a **full-stack website chatbot** using **LangChain** and **OpenAI**, entirely on the **free tier**. This project is designed to help you understand how to integrate large language models into real-world applications without relying on paid tools. By the end, you'll have a fully functional chatbot that can hold multi-turn conversations directly on your website.

### 🎯 Chatbot Use Case: Conversational Website Assistant

The bot we'll build acts like a customer-facing assistant capable of:

- Holding a conversation (with memory)
- Answering questions based on previous inputs
- Responding naturally using an LLM like GPT-3.5 or open-source alternatives
- Running entirely within a free deployment setup (Railway + Vercel)

Think of it as a **starter template** for:

- Support bots for SaaS
- Product FAQs bots
- Personal portfolio site assistants
- E-learning bots for documentation

### 🧱 Project Stack Breakdown

Here’s the tech stack we’ll use:

#### Backend

- **Node.js + Express** — lightweight API server
- **LangChain (JS)** — orchestrates the LLM + memory + chains
- **OpenAI / Hugging Face** — for the LLM interface (we'll support both)
- **BufferMemory** — to track past user-bot interactions in memory

#### Frontend

- **React + TailwindCSS** — clean, minimal UI for the chatbot
- Fetch-based API calls to our backend

#### Deployment

- **Vercel** (Frontend)
- **Railway** (Backend)
- GitHub for version control and CI/CD

### 💸 Free-Tier Strategy: Cost-Conscious from the Ground Up

This project is built for developers who want to:

- Avoid vendor lock-in
- Experiment without needing a credit card
- Prototype with generous free usage limits

Here’s how we handle common cost-related blockers:

| Concern    | Free-Tier Solution                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LLM Usage  | OpenAI free-tier key or Hugging Face API (text-generation-inference) |
| Vector DB  | `Chroma` - local, embedded vector store                              |
| Deployment | Vercel (free hobby plan) + Railway (free backend instance)           |

You’ll be able to run this bot **end-to-end for \$0/month**.

### 🧩 Architecture Preview

The high-level flow looks like this:

```plaintext
User Input -> React Frontend -> Express API -> LangChain LLM Chain -> LLM Response -> Back to User
```

- Memory is preserved in the backend per session (in-process for now)
- Optional file upload uses LangChain's RAG tools with Chroma (all local)

### 📁 Folder Structure (Planned)

We’ll structure our project clearly for modularity:

```plaintext
/chatbot-openai-langchain-starter
|-- client/            # React frontend
|-- server/            # Express + LangChain backend
|   |-- routes/
|   |-- llm/
|   |-- memory/
|-- .env               # For API keys
|-- README.md          # Setup instructions
```

### 🚀 Next Steps

Now that we know what we’re building and how everything fits together, it’s time to get our hands dirty. In the next section, we’ll:

- Scaffold the backend
- Set up LangChain and connect to an LLM
- Write our first API route

Let’s go build a chatbot, shall we? 🛠️
