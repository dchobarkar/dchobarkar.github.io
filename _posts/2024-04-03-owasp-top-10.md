# Building Secure Apps - 03: OWASP Top 10: The Most Critical Web Application Security Risks

## Introduction: OWASP Top 10 and Its Importance in Web Security

### Overview of the OWASP Top 10: What it is and its Importance in Web Security

The **OWASP Top 10** is a globally recognized standard that highlights the most critical security risks to web applications. Published by the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**, this list is updated periodically to reflect new threats and trends in web security. The goal of the OWASP Top 10 is to raise awareness among developers, security professionals, and businesses about the most common vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of web applications, so they can implement effective mitigation strategies.

The OWASP Top 10 provides valuable insights into vulnerabilities that malicious attackers frequently exploit, offering both an educational framework and practical guidance. Some of the most common vulnerabilities include **SQL injection**, **cross-site scripting (XSS)**, and **security misconfigurations**, which can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and service disruptions. By addressing the risks in the OWASP Top 10, developers can build more secure web applications that protect user data and preserve business integrity.

### Why Understanding the OWASP Top 10 is Crucial for Developers and Businesses

Understanding the **OWASP Top 10** is crucial for both developers and businesses because:

1. **Reducing the Risk of Cyberattacks**: With the rise in cyberattacks targeting web applications, being aware of the top vulnerabilities helps teams proactively address risks before they are exploited. Attackers continuously scan for weaknesses in applications, and even a minor security flaw can lead to serious breaches.
2. **Compliance and Legal Requirements**: Many industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, must comply with strict data protection regulations like **GDPR** or **HIPAA**. Implementing security measures based on the OWASP Top 10 can help companies meet compliance requirements and avoid significant fines or legal consequences.
3. **Maintaining Business Reputation and Trust**: Data breaches or service interruptions caused by vulnerabilities can severely damage a business’s reputation and erode customer trust. Addressing vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10 helps businesses avoid high-profile security incidents and fosters long-term user trust.
4. **Cost Efficiency in Fixing Vulnerabilities**: Fixing vulnerabilities early in the development process is far less expensive than addressing them after deployment. By integrating security best practices based on the OWASP Top 10, development teams can reduce technical debt and avoid costly, time-consuming security fixes after vulnerabilities have been exploited.

## Injection Attacks: A Critical OWASP Vulnerability

### Definition: What Are Injection Attacks?

Injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious data into a program, causing it to execute unintended commands or access unauthorized data. Injection vulnerabilities are among the most severe security risks in web applications because they can lead to significant data breaches, unauthorized system access, and even complete compromise of the application.

Common types of injection attacks include:

- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: This occurs when attackers insert malicious SQL queries into input fields that are passed directly to the database without proper sanitization. If exploited, attackers can manipulate the database to execute arbitrary commands, such as retrieving or deleting sensitive information.
- **NoSQL Injection**: Similar to SQL injection, NoSQL injection targets NoSQL databases like MongoDB, where attackers exploit improperly sanitized inputs to modify database queries.
- **Command Injection**: Command injection occurs when attackers insert arbitrary commands into a system command or script executed by the server, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions, such as manipulating files, running commands, or gaining control of the server.

### Real-World Example: High-Profile SQL Injection Breaches

One of the most infamous SQL injection attacks occurred in 2014 when **Sony Pictures** suffered a massive data breach. Hackers exploited SQL injection vulnerabilities in Sony's web applications to access confidential data, including emails, employee information, and unreleased movies. This breach resulted in significant financial losses, legal complications, and reputational damage for Sony.

Another high-profile case involved **TalkTalk**, a UK-based telecommunications company, in 2015. Attackers exploited SQL injection vulnerabilities in the company’s website to gain access to sensitive customer data, including names, addresses, and financial details. This breach affected over 150,000 customers and led to a £400,000 fine from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for failing to safeguard personal data.

These examples highlight how devastating SQL injection attacks can be if not properly mitigated.

### Mitigation Strategies

To prevent injection attacks, it is essential to implement robust security practices that include **prepared statements**, **input validation**, and **sanitization** of user inputs.

#### 1. Use of Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries

The most effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use **prepared statements** and **parameterized queries**. Instead of embedding user inputs directly into SQL queries, prepared statements ensure that user inputs are treated as data, not executable code.

**Prepared Statements**:

- A prepared statement precompiles the SQL query, leaving placeholders for user input. The input is then safely bound to these placeholders as data, ensuring that the input cannot alter the SQL command.

**Code Snippet: Secure Implementation of a Prepared Statement in Node.js (MySQL)**

```javascript
const mysql = require("mysql");

// Create a connection to the database
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "your_user",
  password: "your_password",
  database: "your_database",
});

// SQL query using a prepared statement
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";

const username = "user_input";
const password = "user_input";

// Execute the query safely using parameterized input
connection.query(query, [username, password], (error, results, fields) => {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log(results);
});

connection.end();
```

In this example, the query is precompiled, and user inputs (`username` and `password`) are passed safely as parameters, preventing any potential SQL injection.

#### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

In addition to using prepared statements, it’s important to validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing them. This ensures that only expected data types (e.g., strings, numbers) are accepted and that harmful characters or scripts are removed.

**Input Validation**:

- Ensure that user inputs conform to the expected format (e.g., email validation, length limits) before sending them to the server or database.

**Input Sanitization**:

- Remove or escape potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `<script>`, `'`, `--`, etc.) to prevent them from being interpreted as part of the SQL query or system command.

**Code Snippet: Input Validation in Node.js (Express + Validator.js)**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { body, validationResult } = require("express-validator");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post(
  "/login",
  [
    // Validate and sanitize user inputs
    body("username").trim().isAlphanumeric().escape(),
    body("password").trim().isLength({ min: 6 }).escape(),
  ],
  (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }

    // Process login logic if validation passes
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    // Logic for secure database query (e.g., using prepared statements)
    res.send("Login successful");
  }
);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

In this example, **Validator.js** is used to validate and sanitize user input for the `username` and `password` fields. This ensures that only valid alphanumeric characters are accepted for the username, and dangerous characters are escaped to prevent injection attacks.

#### 3. Mitigation for NoSQL Injection

When working with NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), similar injection vulnerabilities can occur if user input is not sanitized properly. To prevent NoSQL injection, always sanitize inputs and use strict query parameterization.

**Code Snippet: Mitigation for NoSQL Injection in MongoDB**

```javascript
const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb", (err, db) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  const dbo = db.db("mydb");
  const username = "user_input";
  const password = "user_input";

  // Use strict equality checks to prevent NoSQL injection
  dbo
    .collection("users")
    .findOne({ username: username, password: password }, (err, result) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(result);
      db.close();
    });
});
```

In this example, user inputs are passed directly into MongoDB’s query using strict equality checks, ensuring that the query structure cannot be modified by the user.

By following these mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks, protect sensitive data, and improve the overall security of their web applications.

## Broken Authentication: A Critical OWASP Vulnerability

### Definition: What Is Broken Authentication?

**Broken authentication** refers to vulnerabilities in the authentication process that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to a web application. This can happen due to weak or improperly implemented authentication mechanisms, such as poor password management, improper session handling, or lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA). When authentication is broken, attackers can impersonate legitimate users, leading to data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Some common issues that contribute to broken authentication include:

- **Weak Passwords**: Allowing users to create simple, easily guessable passwords or using default credentials.
- **Unencrypted Password Storage**: Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak encryption algorithms.
- **Session Management Issues**: Insecure session handling, where session tokens can be intercepted or reused by attackers.
- **Lack of MFA**: Relying solely on password-based authentication without adding an extra layer of security.

### Real-World Example: Data Breaches Caused by Weak Authentication Controls

One of the most significant data breaches caused by broken authentication occurred in 2012 when **LinkedIn** was hacked. Attackers were able to gain access to millions of users' credentials due to weak password hashing practices. LinkedIn was storing passwords using the **SHA-1** hashing algorithm, which is now considered outdated and insecure. Once the attackers obtained the hashed passwords, they were able to crack them using brute force attacks, exposing millions of user accounts.

Another example is the **Yahoo data breach** that occurred between 2013 and 2016. Weak authentication practices and poor session management allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. In this case, a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) made it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.

### Mitigation Strategies

To protect web applications from broken authentication vulnerabilities, it is essential to implement secure authentication mechanisms. Below are some key strategies for mitigating broken authentication:

#### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification before they can access their accounts. In addition to a password, users might be required to enter a one-time code sent to their phone, use an authenticator app, or verify their identity through biometric data.

**Benefits of MFA**:

- Even if an attacker steals a user's password, they won't be able to access the account without the second authentication factor.
- It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to stolen or compromised passwords.

**Code Snippet: Implementing MFA Using Google Authenticator in Node.js**

```javascript
const speakeasy = require("speakeasy");
const QRCode = require("qrcode");

// Generate a secret for the user
const secret = speakeasy.generateSecret({ length: 20 });

console.log("Secret:", secret.base32); // Store this in the user's account in the database

// Generate a QR code for scanning by an authenticator app
QRCode.toDataURL(secret.otpauth_url, (err, data_url) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data_url); // Display this QR code for the user to scan
});

// Verifying the one-time token during login
const userToken = "123456"; // Token entered by the user
const verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({
  secret: secret.base32,
  encoding: "base32",
  token: userToken,
});

console.log("Verified:", verified); // True if the token is valid, false otherwise
```

In this example, the **speakeasy** library generates a one-time password (OTP) secret that can be scanned by the user's authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator). The user enters the OTP during login, and the server verifies it against the stored secret.

#### 2. Secure Password Storage

Storing passwords securely is critical to preventing them from being exposed in the event of a data breach. Instead of storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms, web applications should use secure hashing algorithms such as **bcrypt** or **PBKDF2**. These algorithms are designed to make it computationally expensive to crack passwords by applying multiple rounds of hashing.

**Benefits of Secure Password Storage**:

- Even if an attacker gains access to the hashed passwords, it will take significant time and resources to crack them.
- Modern algorithms like **bcrypt** also include a "salt" (random data) that makes it harder to use precomputed tables (e.g., rainbow tables) for cracking passwords.

**Code Snippet: Implementing Secure Password Hashing Using bcrypt in Node.js**

```javascript
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");

// Hashing a password before storing it in the database
const saltRounds = 10;
const plainPassword = "user_password";

bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Hashed Password:", hash); // Store this hash in the database
});

// Verifying a password during login
const storedHash = "$2b$10$..."; // Hashed password stored in the database

bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, storedHash, (err, result) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Password Match:", result); // True if the password is correct, false otherwise
});
```

In this example, the **bcrypt** library is used to hash a user's password before storing it in the database. The password is hashed with a salt, which makes it computationally expensive for attackers to crack the password using brute force or dictionary attacks. When the user logs in, the password entered is compared with the stored hash to verify its correctness.

#### 3. Session Management and Secure Cookies

Proper session management ensures that user sessions are protected from hijacking and fixation attacks. Sessions should be managed securely by using **HTTP-only cookies**, **secure cookies**, and **session expiration policies**.

- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Marking cookies as **HTTP-only** prevents client-side scripts from accessing them, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Secure Cookies**: Marking cookies as **secure** ensures that they are only transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.
- **Session Expiration**: Implementing a session expiration policy automatically logs users out after a certain period of inactivity, reducing the window for session hijacking.

**Code Snippet: Implementing Secure Session Management in Express.js**

```javascript
const session = require("express-session");

app.use(
  session({
    secret: "your_secret_key",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: true, // Prevent access by client-side scripts
      secure: true, // Ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS
      maxAge: 60000, // Set session expiration time (e.g., 1 minute)
    },
  })
);
```

In this example, session cookies are set to **HTTP-only** and **secure**, and the session has a maximum lifespan of one minute. After this period, the user will need to log in again, providing an additional layer of security.

By implementing these mitigation strategies—MFA, secure password storage, and proper session management—developers can greatly reduce the risk of broken authentication vulnerabilities. Protecting user authentication mechanisms is critical to safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining the trust of users.
