# From Web to Web3 - 08: Scaling Solutions and Performance Optimization

## 🚦 Introduction

As blockchain technology matures, one of the biggest bottlenecks in its mass adoption remains glaringly obvious: **scalability**. Ethereum, the most widely used smart contract platform, is powerful—but it’s also limited in terms of **transactions per second (TPS)**, and that limitation has far-reaching consequences for developers and users alike 🐌💸

### 🧱 Overview of Ethereum's Scalability Problem

Ethereum currently processes around **15–30 TPS**, a number dwarfed by traditional systems like Visa (which handles thousands of TPS). As more dApps go live and user activity surges—especially during NFT mints or DeFi events—the Ethereum network gets clogged, leading to:

- **Sky-high gas fees** 🤑
- **Delayed confirmations**
- **Failed or reverted transactions**

This congestion isn’t just frustrating—it’s a structural issue that affects every product built on the Ethereum base layer.

### ⚙️ Why Performance Optimization Matters

In Web2, performance optimization is about faster load times and smoother interfaces. In Web3, it's about **making your dApp accessible**. A great product becomes unusable if every transaction costs $50 or takes several minutes to confirm. That's why performance isn’t just a “nice-to-have”—it’s **mission-critical**.

By improving performance, developers can:

- Increase **user retention**
- Reduce **barriers to entry**
- Enable **scalability** for real-world use cases (gaming, payments, social apps)
- Lower **infrastructure costs** for dApp operations

### 🔥 Real-World Consequences

Here’s what poor performance looks like in production:

- **NFT gas wars** where mint prices spike to hundreds of dollars
- Users **abandoning DeFi protocols** due to expensive swaps or staking
- Game economies stagnating because **microtransactions aren't viable**
- Onboarding friction due to **complex bridge UX or failed txs**

For developers, it means **frustrated users, failed onboarding, and revenue loss**.
