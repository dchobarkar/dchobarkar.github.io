# TypeScript - 02: TypeScript Basics

## Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript has emerged as an indispensable tool for JavaScript developers seeking to bring more robustness and clarity to their code. At its core, TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types, making it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications. This statically typed language compiles down to JavaScript, ensuring that any code written in TypeScript can run anywhere JavaScript does. The real power of TypeScript lies in its type system, which not only helps in catching errors early during development but also enhances code documentation, autocompletion, and navigation in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

## Understanding TypeScript's Core Types

TypeScript enhances JavaScript's dynamic typing with a flexible and powerful static type system. This system categorizes data into two broad categories: Basic Types and Object Types.

### Basic Types

TypeScript introduces several basic data types, which are extensions of JavaScript's types:

- **String**: Represents textual data, just like in JavaScript. Example: `let greeting: string = 'Hello, TypeScript!';`

- **Number**: Covers both integers and floating-point numbers. Example: `let age: number = 30;`

- **Boolean**: Represents true/false values. Example: `let isTypeScriptFun: boolean = true;`

- **Null and Undefined**: Represent the absence of a value, with `null` being an intentional absence, and `undefined` typically representing uninitialized variables.

- **Symbol**: A unique and immutable data type introduced in ES6, useful for creating unique object keys.

- **BigInt**: For handling numbers larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

Each of these types ensures that variables and functions operate on data that is expected, significantly reducing the common type-related errors seen in JavaScript.

### Object Types

Beyond basic types, TypeScript allows for detailed typing of arrays, functions, and objects:

- **Arrays**: Can be typed to hold specific types of values. Example: `let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];`

- **Functions**: TypeScript can annotate parameters and return types. Example:

```jsx
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

- **Classes**: TypeScript classes support typing within the constructor, methods, and properties.

This categorization into basic and object types, and the ability to define interfaces and generics (discussed in later articles), makes TypeScript's type system a powerful tool for development.

## Variables in TypeScript

Variables in TypeScript can be declared using `let` and `const`, similar to ES6 JavaScript, but with added type annotations. These annotations provide explicit type information to the compiler:

```jsx
let userName: string = "John Doe";
const userAge: number = 32;
```

Type annotations help catch type-related errors at compile time, ensuring that variables are always assigned and used with the correct type of data. For instance, attempting to assign a string to `userAge` would result in a compilation error, immediately alerting the developer to the mismatch.

TypeScript also supports type inference, where the compiler automatically deduces the type of a variable from its initial value, reducing the need for explicit type annotations in some cases. However, explicit typing is encouraged for clearer code and better documentation.

## Functions in TypeScript

Functions in TypeScript not only organize code into reusable blocks but also provide a powerful mechanism for encapsulating operations with typed parameters and return values, enhancing code reliability and readability.

### Defining Functions

TypeScript allows for explicit type annotations for both parameters and return values of functions:

```jsx
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

This ensures that the function can only be called with numbers and will return a number, catching errors at compile time if any other type is passed.

### Optional, Default, and Rest Parameters

TypeScript functions can have optional parameters (marked with a `?`), default parameters, and rest parameters for handling varying numbers of arguments:

```jsx
function greet(name: string, greeting: string = "Hello"): string {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}

function sum(...numbers: number[]): number {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0);
}
```

### Overloads

Function overloads allow a function to be called with different parameter types and numbers, offering compile-time checks and autocompletion support in IDEs:

```jsx
function getInfo(name: string): string;
function getInfo(age: number): number;
function getInfo(value: string | number): string | number {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
        return `Name: ${value}`;
    } else {
        return `Age: ${value}`;
    }
}
```

## Type Inference

TypeScript is intelligent enough to infer types in many situations, reducing the need for explicit type annotations while still providing the benefits of type safety:

```jsx
let message = "Hello, TypeScript"; // `message` is inferred to be of type `string`
```

Type inference works in function returns, variable declarations, and many other places, making TypeScript code concise yet robust.

## Type Assertions

Type assertions in TypeScript allow developers to tell the compiler to treat an entity as a different type than the one inferred:

```jsx
let someValue: any = "this is a string";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```

This is particularly useful when the developer has certain knowledge about the type of a value that TypeScript can't infer on its own. However, it should be used judiciously, as incorrect assertions can lead to runtime errors.

## Union and Intersection Types

Union and intersection types in TypeScript allow for more flexible code design by enabling variables to hold values of multiple types and combining types to create new ones, respectively.

### Union Types

Union types are defined using the `|` symbol and allow variables to store values of two or more different types:

```jsx
let mixedType: string | number;
mixedType = "Hello, TypeScript"; // Valid
mixedType = 42; // Also valid
```

They are particularly useful in scenarios where a variable might genuinely hold more than one type of value, enhancing code flexibility without sacrificing type safety.

### Intersection Types

Intersection types, denoted by the `&` symbol, combine multiple types into one:

```jsx
interface Name {
  name: string;
}

interface Age {
  age: number;
}

type Person = Name & Age;

let employee: Person = { name: "John", age: 30 }; // Must have both `name` and `age`
```

This is especially powerful when integrating different sets of data or enhancing functionality with mixin patterns.

## Advanced Types

TypeScript's type system goes beyond basic types with advanced constructs like enums, tuples, and generics, offering robust tools for defining and manipulating data structures.

### Enums

Enums allow for defining a set of named constants, either numeric or string-based, enhancing code clarity and reducing errors:

```jsx
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}
```

### Tuples

Tuples are arrays with fixed sizes and known data types at each index, perfect for representing a set of values of varied types:

```jsx
let person: [string, number] = ["John", 30];
```

### Generics

Generics provide a way to create reusable and flexible components that work with any data type, maintaining type safety:

```jsx
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
```

## Best Practices

Effectively leveraging TypeScript's type system involves:

- Using strict mode for stricter type-checking.

- Avoiding `any` type as much as possible to benefit from TypeScript's full capabilities.

- Embracing advanced types and generics for reusable code.

## Conclusion

Understanding TypeScript's core types, functions, and type annotations lays the groundwork for robust application development. By mastering these concepts and practicing with real-world projects, developers can write more maintainable, error-free code. The journey into TypeScript's advanced features promises even greater control and expressiveness in web development.
