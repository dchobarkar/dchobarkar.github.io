## Introduction to Image Optimization

In the fast-paced realm of web development, the performance of a website can significantly impact user engagement, retention, and conversion rates. One of the most effective ways to boost site performance is through rigorous image optimization. This process not only accelerates page load times but also enhances the overall user experience, making it a crucial practice for developers aiming to maintain competitive and efficient online platforms.
