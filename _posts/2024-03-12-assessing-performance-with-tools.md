2. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** The time it takes for the largest content element to be visible within the viewport. This metric reflects the loading performance of the main content.

3. **FID (First Input Delay):** Measures the time from when a user first interacts with the page to when the browser responds to that interaction. It indicates the responsiveness of a page.

4. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shift during the page's lifecycle. Lower CLS values indicate better visual stability.

5. **TTI (Time to Interactive):** The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive, meaning it can reliably respond to user input.

#### How These Metrics Impact User Experience and SEO

- **FCP and LCP:** Faster paint times lead to a better first impression and perceived performance, which can reduce bounce rates.

- **FID:** Low input delay ensures a smooth user experience, especially important for interactive elements.

- **CLS:** Stable layouts prevent users from misclicking or experiencing visual jarring.

- **TTI:** Ensures that users can interact with the page as soon as possible, enhancing usability and satisfaction.

### 4. Improving Performance Based on Lighthouse Recommendations

#### Common Performance Issues Identified by Lighthouse

1. **Render-Blocking Resources:** Scripts and stylesheets that delay the rendering of content.

2. **Unoptimized Images:** Large, uncompressed images that slow down load times.

3. **Inefficient JavaScript:** Heavy or poorly written JavaScript that affects performance.

4. **Excessive DOM Size:** Large or complex Document Object Model (DOM) structures that impact rendering performance.

#### Practical Steps and Code Snippets to Address These Issues

##### Render-Blocking Resources

1. Defer or async JavaScript loading:

   ```html
   <script src="script.js" defer></script>
   ```

2. Inline critical CSS and load non-critical CSS asynchronously:

   ```html
   <link
     rel="stylesheet"
     href="styles.css"
     media="print"
     onload="this.media='all'"
   />
   ```

##### Unoptimized Images

1. Use modern image formats like WebP:

   ```html
   <img src="image.webp" alt="Description" />
   ```

2. Lazy load images:

   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />
   ```

##### Inefficient JavaScript

1. Minify and bundle JavaScript files using tools like Webpack:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
   ```

2. Remove unused JavaScript (tree-shaking).

##### Excessive DOM Size

1. Simplify DOM structure by reducing nested elements.

2. Use efficient frameworks and libraries that manage the DOM effectively.

#### Case Studies of Performance Improvements Using Lighthouse Recommendations

1. **E-commerce Site:**
