   ```html
   <script src="script.js" defer></script>
   ```

2. Inline critical CSS and load non-critical CSS asynchronously:

   ```html
   <link
     rel="stylesheet"
     href="styles.css"
     media="print"
     onload="this.media='all'"
   />
   ```

##### Unoptimized Images

1. Use modern image formats like WebP:

   ```html
   <img src="image.webp" alt="Description" />
   ```

2. Lazy load images:

   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />
   ```

##### Inefficient JavaScript

1. Minify and bundle JavaScript files using tools like Webpack:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
   ```

2. Remove unused JavaScript (tree-shaking).

##### Excessive DOM Size

1. Simplify DOM structure by reducing nested elements.

2. Use efficient frameworks and libraries that manage the DOM effectively.

#### Case Studies of Performance Improvements Using Lighthouse Recommendations

1. **E-commerce Site:**

#### Why Custom Metrics are Important

Custom performance metrics provide a tailored view of how well your website meets specific user experiences and business goals. While standard metrics like FCP, LCP, and TTI are crucial for understanding general performance, custom metrics allow you to focus on what matters most for your users and business. These metrics can measure unique interactions, user flows, and business-critical events that are not covered by default performance tools.

Custom metrics help in:

- **Understanding User Behavior:** Track specific actions and interactions that are important for your users.

- **Optimizing Key Performance Areas:** Focus on areas that directly impact business goals, such as conversion rates or user engagement.

- **Providing Specific Insights:** Gain detailed insights into specific parts of your website, allowing for targeted optimizations.

#### Examples of Custom Metrics

1. **Time to First Interaction (TTFI):** Measures the time taken for a user to make the first meaningful interaction on the page.

2. **Time to Complete Checkout:** In e-commerce sites, tracks the time from adding an item to the cart to completing the purchase.

3. **Form Submission Time:** Measures the time taken to fill and submit a form.

4. **Content Engagement Time:** Tracks the time users spend engaging with specific content, such as videos or articles.

### 2. Setting Up Custom Metrics

#### Using the PerformanceObserver API to Track Custom Metrics

The PerformanceObserver API allows you to observe and collect performance entries as they occur. This API is useful for tracking custom performance metrics in real-time.

```javascript
// Example of using PerformanceObserver to track custom metrics
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries();
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    console.log(`Name: ${entry.name}, Duration: ${entry.duration}`);
  });
});

// Start observing
observer.observe({ entryTypes: ["measure"] });

// Measure custom events
performance.mark("start-custom-metric");
// Simulate some operation
setTimeout(() => {
  performance.mark("end-custom-metric");
  performance.measure(
    "Custom Metric",
    "start-custom-metric",
    "end-custom-metric"
  );
}, 1000);
```

#### Implementing Custom JavaScript to Measure User Interactions and Timings

You can create custom JavaScript functions to measure specific user interactions and timings. This involves using the `performance.now()` method to capture high-resolution timestamps.

```javascript
// Track time to first interaction
let firstInteraction = false;

function trackFirstInteraction() {
  if (!firstInteraction) {
    firstInteraction = true;
    const ttfInteraction = performance.now();
    console.log(`Time to First Interaction: ${ttfInteraction} ms`);
    // Send this metric to your analytics server
  }
}

document.addEventListener("click", trackFirstInteraction);
document.addEventListener("keydown", trackFirstInteraction);
```

#### Code Snippets and Examples

1. **Custom Metric for Content Engagement Time:**

```javascript
// Track engagement time for a specific content section
let engagementStart;
const contentSection = document.getElementById("content-section");

contentSection.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => {
  engagementStart = performance.now();
});

contentSection.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
  if (engagementStart) {
    const engagementTime = performance.now() - engagementStart;
    console.log(`Content Engagement Time: ${engagementTime} ms`);
    // Send this metric to your analytics server
  }
});
```

2. **Custom Metric for Form Submission Time:**

```javascript
// Track time to complete form submission
const form = document.getElementById("form");
let formStartTime;

form.addEventListener(
  "focusin",
  () => {
    formStartTime = performance.now();
  },
  { once: true }
);

form.addEventListener("submit", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const formEndTime = performance.now();
  const formSubmissionTime = formEndTime - formStartTime;
  console.log(`Form Submission Time: ${formSubmissionTime} ms`);
  // Send this metric to your analytics server
});
```

function sendCustomMetric(name, value) {
  gtag("event", "timing_complete", {
    name: name,
    value: value,
    event_category: "Custom Metrics",
  });
}

// Example usage
sendCustomMetric("Content Engagement Time", engagementTime);
```

##### New Relic

New Relic allows you to send custom events and metrics using its JavaScript API:

```javascript
// Send custom metric to New Relic
newrelic.addPageAction("customMetric", {
  name: "Content Engagement Time",
  value: engagementTime,
});
```
