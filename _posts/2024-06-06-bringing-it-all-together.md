## 🌐 Designing the RESTful API

Designing a well-structured and efficient RESTful API is crucial for building robust applications, whether it's a blogging platform or an e-commerce site. This section focuses on creating clear, consistent, and predictable API endpoints, adhering to RESTful principles, and following best practices. We'll explore resource-based design strategies and implement a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Express.js.

### 🚦 Endpoint Design: Defining Clear and Predictable Endpoints

An effective RESTful API offers predictable and logical endpoints, making it easier for developers to integrate and interact with the system. Depending on the project type, the API endpoints will vary:

#### 📝 For a Blogging Platform:

- **User Management:**

  - `GET /users`: Fetch all users.
  - `POST /users`: Create a new user.
  - `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve a specific user's details.
  - `PUT /users/{id}`: Update a user's information.
  - `DELETE /users/{id}`: Remove a user.

- **Posts and Comments:**

  - `GET /posts`: Fetch all blog posts.
  - `POST /posts`: Create a new blog post.
  - `GET /posts/{id}`: Retrieve a specific post.
  - `PUT /posts/{id}`: Update an existing post.
  - `DELETE /posts/{id}`: Delete a post.
  - `GET /posts/{id}/comments`: Get comments for a specific post.
  - `POST /posts/{id}/comments`: Add a comment to a post.

#### 🛒 For an E-commerce Application:

- **Product Management:**

  - `GET /products`: Fetch all products.
  - `POST /products`: Add a new product.
  - `GET /products/{id}`: Get a specific product's details.
  - `PUT /products/{id}`: Update product information.
  - `DELETE /products/{id}`: Delete a product.

- **Order Management:**

  - `GET /orders`: Retrieve all orders.
  - `POST /orders`: Create a new order.
  - `GET /orders/{id}`: Get details of a specific order.
  - `PUT /orders/{id}`: Update order status or details.
  - `DELETE /orders/{id}`: Cancel an order.

- **User Management:**

  - `GET /users`: Fetch all registered users.
  - `POST /users`: Register a new user.
  - `GET /users/{id}`: Get a user's profile.
  - `PUT /users/{id}`: Update user profile.
  - `DELETE /users/{id}`: Remove a user from the system.

### 🧮 Resource-Based Design: Following RESTful Principles

A RESTful API should follow a **resource-based design** that uses HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. The API endpoints should be **intuitive** and **self-explanatory**, relying on the following principles:

#### 🌐 HTTP Methods and Their Usage:

- **GET:** Retrieve data without modifying the resource.
- **POST:** Submit data to create a new resource.
- **PUT:** Update an existing resource or create a resource if it does not exist.
- **DELETE:** Remove a resource.

#### 🛠 Examples of Resource-Based Endpoints:

1. **Fetch All Products:**

```http
GET /products
```

2. **Create a New Order:**

```http
POST /orders
```

3. **Update User Information:**

```http
PUT /users/{id}
```

4. **Delete a Comment on a Post:**

```http
DELETE /posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}
```

### 🛠 Best Practices for RESTful API Design

To create a **maintainable** and **developer-friendly** API, follow these best practices:

#### 📌 Use Plural Nouns for Endpoints:

- ✅ `/products` instead of ❌ `/product`
- ✅ `/users` instead of ❌ `/getUser`

#### 📌 Avoid Verbs in URIs:

- ✅ `POST /orders` instead of ❌ `/createOrder`
- ✅ `DELETE /products/{id}` instead of ❌ `/deleteProduct`

#### 📌 Implement Hierarchical URIs:

- When dealing with **nested resources**, maintain a clear hierarchy.
- ✅ `GET /posts/{postId}/comments` to fetch comments for a specific post.

#### 📌 Support Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination:

- Filtering: `GET /products?category=electronics&price=gt:100`
- Sorting: `GET /products?sort=price:asc`
- Pagination: `GET /products?page=2&limit=20`

### 💻 Code Snippet: Implementing a Basic CRUD API with Express.js

Below is an example of how to set up a basic API with Express.js to manage **products** in an e-commerce application:

#### 1. 📂 Setting Up the Express Router

```typescript
// src/routes/productRoutes.ts

import express, { Request, Response } from "express";

const router = express.Router();

// Mock data
let products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 1000 },
  { id: 2, name: "Smartphone", price: 500 },
];

// GET /products - Fetch all products
router.get("/products", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json(products);
});

// POST /products - Create a new product
router.post("/products", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const newProduct = { id: Date.now(), ...req.body };
  products.push(newProduct);
  res.status(201).json(newProduct);
});

// GET /products/:id - Retrieve a specific product
router.get("/products/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const product = products.find((p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!product) return res.status(404).send("Product not found");
  res.json(product);
});

// PUT /products/:id - Update an existing product
router.put("/products/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const productIndex = products.findIndex(
    (p) => p.id === parseInt(req.params.id)
  );
  if (productIndex === -1) return res.status(404).send("Product not found");

  products[productIndex] = { ...products[productIndex], ...req.body };
  res.json(products[productIndex]);
});

// DELETE /products/:id - Remove a product
router.delete("/products/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  products = products.filter((p) => p.id !== parseInt(req.params.id));
  res.status(204).send();
});

export default router;
```

#### 2. 🚀 Integrating Routes with Express Application

```typescript
// src/app.ts

import express from "express";
import productRoutes from "./routes/productRoutes";

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use("/api", productRoutes);

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:5000");
});
```

#### 3. 🛠 Testing Endpoints with Postman or Curl

```bash
# Fetch all products
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products

# Create a new product
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"Tablet","price":300}' \
http://localhost:5000/api/products
```
