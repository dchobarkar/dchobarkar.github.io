## 🔍 Overview of REST and GraphQL

### ✨ REST (Representational State Transfer)

#### Core Concepts

REST is a widely adopted architectural style for designing networked applications. It leverages standard HTTP methods and a stateless architecture, which simplifies interactions between clients and servers.

- **Resources:** In REST, everything is considered a resource (e.g., users, products, orders). Each resource is identified by a **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**.
- **URIs:** URIs uniquely identify resources. For example:
  ```http
  GET /users/1
  POST /users
  PUT /users/1
  DELETE /users/1
  ```
- **HTTP Methods:** REST uses standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:
  - `GET`: Retrieve a resource.
  - `POST`: Create a new resource.
  - `PUT`: Update an existing resource.
  - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.
- **Statelessness:** Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store session information.

#### Architecture

RESTful APIs follow a **resource-based architecture**, where endpoints correspond directly to resources. This design encourages a predictable and structured approach to API development. A typical RESTful endpoint structure might look like:

```http
GET /products           # Retrieve a list of products
GET /products/123       # Retrieve a specific product
POST /products          # Create a new product
PUT /products/123       # Update an existing product
DELETE /products/123    # Delete a product
```

#### History & Evolution

REST was introduced by **Roy Fielding** in his doctoral dissertation in 2000. It quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and alignment with web standards. REST became the go-to choice for web APIs, providing a standardized approach that worked well with the stateless nature of HTTP.

Over time, as web applications grew in complexity, REST's limitations in handling complex data relationships and over-fetching/under-fetching of data became apparent, leading to the development of alternatives like GraphQL.

### ⚡ GraphQL (Graph Query Language)

#### Core Concepts

GraphQL is a **query language for APIs** that provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST. It enables clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more.

- **Single Endpoint:** Unlike REST, which uses multiple endpoints, GraphQL APIs typically expose a **single endpoint** for all operations:
  ```http
  POST /graphql
  ```
- **Queries and Mutations:**
  - **Queries:** Used to read or fetch values.
  - **Mutations:** Used to write or modify values.
- **Subscriptions:** Allow clients to subscribe to real-time updates.
- **Schema-Driven Development:** GraphQL APIs are strongly typed. The schema defines the structure of the API, specifying the types of data that can be queried or modified.

#### Architecture

GraphQL APIs are **flexible and client-driven**. Clients specify the shape and structure of the required data in a single request, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.

##### Example: GraphQL Query

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        content
        author {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Corresponding Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "posts": [
        {
          "title": "GraphQL vs REST",
          "comments": [
            {
              "content": "Great post!",
              "author": { "name": "Bob" }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### History & Adoption

GraphQL was developed by **Facebook** in 2012 to solve challenges encountered with REST. It was later open-sourced in 2015, gaining rapid adoption among companies like GitHub, Shopify, and Twitter due to its efficiency and flexibility.

GraphQL’s rise is attributed to:

- **Efficient data fetching:** Reducing the number of requests required to fetch nested or related data.
- **Faster development cycles:** By decoupling frontend and backend teams, developers can iterate independently.
- **Broad community support:** With tools like Apollo Client and Relay, GraphQL continues to grow in popularity.

#### 🔑 **Key Differences at a Glance**

| Aspect             | REST                              | GraphQL                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Data Fetching**  | Fixed endpoints, over-fetching    | Client-specified, precise data    |

This overview highlights the **fundamental differences** between REST and GraphQL, setting the stage for a deeper exploration into their **use cases**, **performance implications**, and **security considerations** in the sections that follow.

## 🏗 When to Use REST

Understanding when to use **REST** is crucial for developers aiming to design efficient, scalable, and maintainable APIs. REST remains a go-to choice in various scenarios due to its **simplicity**, **predictability**, **caching capabilities**, and **widespread adoption**. Let's explore these factors in detail.

### ✨ Simplicity and Predictability

One of the biggest advantages of REST is its **straightforward and predictable nature**. REST APIs follow a clear convention where each endpoint corresponds to a specific resource, and standard HTTP methods define the operations:

- `GET`: Retrieve data
- `POST`: Create data
- `PUT`: Update data
- `DELETE`: Delete data

#### 🔧 Ideal for CRUD Applications

REST shines in applications requiring **basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**. The predictable URL structure makes it easy for developers to understand and use.

##### 📜 Example: RESTful Endpoint for User Management

```http
GET    /users           # Retrieve all users
GET    /users/{id}      # Retrieve a specific user
POST   /users           # Create a new user
PUT    /users/{id}      # Update an existing user
DELETE /users/{id}      # Delete a user
```

This clear and consistent pattern ensures that developers can intuitively guess the purpose of each endpoint, making integration smoother and reducing the learning curve.

### ⚡ Caching Advantages

Another significant reason to choose REST is its **robust caching capabilities**. Since REST APIs primarily use **HTTP protocols**, they can leverage:

- **Browser-level caching**: GET requests can be cached in the browser, reducing unnecessary network calls.
- **HTTP caching mechanisms**: REST supports caching headers such as `ETag`, `Cache-Control`, and `Expires`, improving performance by reducing server load.

#### 🚀 Example: HTTP Caching Header Usage

```http
GET /products HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
If-None-Match: "abc123"
```

If the resource hasn’t changed, the server can respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

This reduces latency and improves the responsiveness of applications, especially for data that doesn't change frequently.

### 🌐 Wide Adoption and Community Support

**REST APIs** have been around for more than two decades, resulting in **widespread adoption** and a **thriving community**. This has led to:

- **Extensive tooling support**: Frameworks like **Express.js** (Node.js), **Spring Boot** (Java), and **Django REST Framework** (Python) simplify RESTful API development.
- **Robust documentation practices**: Tools like **Swagger/OpenAPI** provide auto-generated documentation, making API usage easier.
- **Reliable client libraries**: REST is supported across nearly all programming languages, ensuring smooth integration.

#### 💡 Example: RESTful API with Express.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

let users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice" },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob" },
];

app.get("/users", (req, res) => res.json(users));

app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
  const newUser = { id: users.length + 1, ...req.body };
  users.push(newUser);
  res.status(201).json(newUser);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

This simple code snippet shows how REST’s intuitive structure accelerates backend development.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **REST is ideal for:**
  - CRUD applications with simple data structures.
  - Scenarios where **predictable endpoints** simplify integration.
  - Applications benefiting from **native HTTP caching** for performance gains.
- **Strengths of REST include:**
  - **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement.
  - **Efficiency:** Optimized for browser-based caching.
  - **Broad support:** Extensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.

REST remains a **reliable, well-established choice** for building APIs that require **simplicity, consistency, and performance** without complex data relationships.

## ⚡ When to Use GraphQL

Choosing **GraphQL** over traditional REST APIs can significantly enhance performance, flexibility, and developer experience, especially in complex applications. This section explores scenarios where GraphQL excels, supported by practical examples and code snippets.

### 🌐 Handling Complex Data Relationships

GraphQL is **ideal for applications with nested data requirements**, such as:

- **Social networks** where user profiles, posts, comments, and likes are interrelated.
- **E-commerce platforms** displaying product details, reviews, seller information, and inventory status.

#### 🔄 Why GraphQL Shines in Complex Structures

With REST, multiple endpoints are required to retrieve related data, leading to multiple round trips. GraphQL addresses this by enabling clients to fetch all necessary data in **a single request**.

##### 📜 Example: GraphQL Query for Nested Data

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        content
        author {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "posts": [
        {
          "title": "GraphQL vs REST",
          "comments": [
            {
              "content": "Great insights!",
              "author": { "name": "Bob" }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This single query retrieves the **user’s profile**, **posts**, and **comments**, eliminating the need for multiple API calls.

### 🚀 Avoiding Over-Fetching and Under-Fetching

In RESTful APIs, clients often receive **too much** (over-fetching) or **too little** (under-fetching) data. GraphQL solves this by allowing clients to specify exactly what they need.

#### 🎯 Performance Boost with Tailored Queries

- **Over-fetching example:** Retrieving full user profiles when only the username is needed.
- **Under-fetching issue:** Multiple API calls to gather related information.

##### 📜 Example: Minimal Data Query

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice"
    }
  }
}
```

With GraphQL, the client fetches **only the required field**, enhancing performance, especially on mobile networks.

### ⚡ Schema Flexibility and Rapid Iterations

GraphQL’s **schema-driven approach** allows APIs to **evolve without breaking changes**. Unlike REST, which often requires versioning (e.g., `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`), GraphQL handles:

- **Rapid product updates:** Frontend teams can request new fields without backend modifications.
- **Backward compatibility:** The API adapts without affecting existing clients.

##### 📜 Example: Adding a New Field

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
    phoneNumber # Newly added field
  }
}
```

The addition of `phoneNumber` requires **no new endpoint**—the GraphQL schema manages it seamlessly.

### 💻 Code Snippet: GraphQL Query and Mutation for User and Post Management

#### 🏗 Query: Retrieve User and Posts

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

#### ✍ Mutation: Create a New Post

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    userId: "1"
    title: "Understanding GraphQL"
    content: "GraphQL simplifies complex data fetching."
  ) {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

#### 📝 Mutation Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPost": {
      "id": "101",
      "title": "Understanding GraphQL",
      "content": "GraphQL simplifies complex data fetching."
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Use GraphQL when:**

  - Applications involve **complex and nested data** relationships.
  - **Performance optimization** is crucial by eliminating over-fetching/under-fetching.
  - You need **rapid iterations** without breaking existing clients.

- **Benefits include:**

  - **Single endpoint efficiency** with tailored data fetching.

  - **Optimized network performance**, ideal for mobile applications and low-bandwidth environments.

GraphQL’s adaptability and performance enhancements make it the preferred choice for **modern, data-intensive applications** that demand flexibility and efficiency.

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

Understanding **performance implications** is essential when choosing between REST and GraphQL. Factors like **network efficiency**, **response times**, and **caching strategies** directly affect application performance. This section explores these aspects with practical insights and code examples.

### 🌐 Network Efficiency

#### 🔄 REST: Multiple Round-Trips for Nested Data

REST APIs often require multiple HTTP requests to gather nested or related data, leading to **increased network latency** and **longer load times**.

##### 📜 Example: REST Calls for User and Posts

```http
GET /users/1          # Fetch user information
GET /users/1/posts    # Fetch posts for the user
GET /posts/101/comments # Fetch comments for a post
```

Each call adds latency, especially in mobile networks or high-latency environments.

#### ⚡ GraphQL: Single Request with Tailored Data Retrieval

GraphQL allows fetching all necessary data in **a single request**, significantly reducing network overhead.

##### 📜 Example: GraphQL Query for Nested Data

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        content
        author {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "posts": [
        {
          "title": "GraphQL vs REST",
          "comments": [
            {
              "content": "Great post!",
              "author": { "name": "Bob" }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The single request approach reduces total network latency, boosting application performance.

### ⏱ Response Times and Latency

#### 🚀 GraphQL’s Advantage in Reducing Payload Sizes

- **REST APIs**: Tend to send fixed payloads, potentially including unnecessary data.
- **GraphQL APIs**: Return **only requested data**, optimizing payload size and reducing load times.

##### 📜 Example: Minimal GraphQL Query

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": { "name": "Alice" }
  }
}
```

By returning only the `name` field, **GraphQL minimizes payload size**, improving performance.

### 📦 Caching Strategies

#### 🗃 REST: Native HTTP Caching

REST APIs can leverage standard HTTP caching mechanisms:

- **Browser caching** for GET requests.
- **HTTP headers** like `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Expires` for optimized performance.

##### 📜 Example: HTTP Caching

```http
GET /products HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
If-None-Match: "abc123"
```

##### 📝 Server Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

This approach reduces unnecessary data transfer, enhancing load times.

#### ⚡ GraphQL: Client-Side Caching and Persisted Queries

Since GraphQL uses a **single endpoint**, HTTP caching is limited. However, it compensates with:

- **Client-side caching** using tools like **Apollo Client** and **Relay**.
- **Persisted queries** to cache complex queries on the server.

##### 📜 Example: Apollo Client Caching (React)

```javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "/graphql",
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

client.query({
  query: gql`
    query GetUser {
      user(id: "1") {
        name
        posts {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  `,
});
```

This caching reduces repeated network calls, enhancing the responsiveness of applications.

### 📊 Code Snippet: Benchmarking API Responses in REST vs. GraphQL

#### 🏃 Benchmark Script (Node.js)

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const benchmark = async (url, payload) => {
  console.time("Response Time");
  await axios.post(url, payload);
  console.timeEnd("Response Time");
};

// REST Benchmark
benchmark("https://api.example.com/users/1", {});

// GraphQL Benchmark
benchmark("https://api.example.com/graphql", {
  query: `{
    user(id: "1") { name posts { title } }
  }`,
});
```

This benchmark helps evaluate performance differences in **response times** and **latency** between REST and GraphQL APIs.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Network Efficiency:**

  - REST: Multiple requests for nested data.
  - GraphQL: Single tailored request reduces overhead.

- **Response Times:**

  - GraphQL’s **smaller payloads** ensure faster responses.

- **Caching Strategies:**

  - REST: Utilizes **native HTTP caching**.
  - GraphQL: Leverages **client-side caching** and **persisted queries**.

Performance considerations should align with project requirements. For applications needing **real-time performance** and **minimal payloads**, **GraphQL** offers distinct advantages. Conversely, REST remains effective where **robust caching** and **predictable endpoints** are priorities.

## 🌐 Real-World Comparison Scenarios

To illustrate the practical differences between **REST** and **GraphQL**, let's explore a real-world scenario: **building a blog platform** with user profiles and posts. This section provides a side-by-side comparison of how both approaches handle the same requirements, supported by relevant **code snippets**.

### 📝 Scenario: Building a Blog Platform

**Requirements:**

- Fetch user profiles along with their associated posts.
- Optimize network performance and reduce data over-fetching.
- Maintain flexibility for future feature additions.

### 🌿 REST Approach

#### 📜 Endpoint Structure:

A RESTful design uses multiple endpoints to handle related data.

##### 🔗 Typical REST Endpoints

```http
GET /users              # Retrieve all users
GET /users/{id}         # Retrieve specific user details
GET /users/{id}/posts   # Retrieve posts for a specific user
GET /posts/{postId}     # Retrieve a specific post
```

#### 🚨 Potential Over-Fetching

If the frontend needs only user names and post titles, REST may still return unnecessary data unless endpoints are specifically designed for each use case.

##### 📜 RESTful API Example (Node.js with Express)

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const users = [{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }];
const posts = [
  {
    id: 101,
    userId: 1,
    title: "GraphQL vs REST",
    content: "Detailed comparison",
  },
];

app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find((u) => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  res.json(user);
});

app.get("/users/:id/posts", (req, res) => {
  const userPosts = posts.filter((p) => p.userId === parseInt(req.params.id));
  res.json(userPosts);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("REST API running on port 3000"));
```

##### ⚠️ Drawback:

- **Multiple round-trips** are required to fetch user and post data.
- **Over-fetching risk** when retrieving fields not needed by the client.

### ⚡ GraphQL Approach

#### 🔗 Single Query Efficiency

GraphQL allows fetching all required data in **one request**, tailored to the client's needs.

##### 📜 GraphQL Schema (User & Post Types)

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

##### 🔄 Query: Fetch User Profiles and Posts

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Query Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "posts": [{ "title": "GraphQL vs REST" }]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 🏗 Resolver Functions (Node.js with Apollo Server)

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    posts: [Post]
  }
  type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    content: String!
  }
  type Query {
    user(id: ID!): User
  }
`;

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }];
const posts = [
  {
    id: "101",
    userId: "1",
    title: "GraphQL vs REST",
    content: "Comparison details",
  },
];

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (_, { id }) => ({
      ...users.find((u) => u.id === id),
      posts: posts.filter((p) => p.userId === id),
    }),
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen().then(({ url }) => console.log(`GraphQL API running at ${url}`));
```

| **Flexibility**   | Fixed endpoints                    | Dynamic queries                  |

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **REST** is suitable for simple, predictable APIs with robust caching needs.
- **GraphQL** excels when clients require **nested data** in a single request, offering **flexibility** and **performance efficiency**.

Both approaches have their strengths; the choice depends on **project requirements**, **performance goals**, and **team expertise**.

## 🛡 Error Handling Differences

Effective error handling is crucial for robust API design. REST and GraphQL have distinct mechanisms for managing errors, each with its own advantages. This section explores these differences with comprehensive explanations and code snippets.

### 🌿 REST: Standard HTTP Status Codes

#### ✅ Key Concepts:

- REST relies on **standard HTTP status codes** to indicate the outcome of requests.
- Common codes include:
  - `200 OK`: Successful request.
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid client request.
  - `404 Not Found`: Resource does not exist.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error.

#### 📜 Example: REST Error Response (Node.js with Express)

```javascript
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find((u) => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).json({
      error: "User not found",
      code: 404,
    });
  }
  res.json(user);
});
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "error": "User not found",
  "code": 404
}
```

#### ⚠️ Pros and Cons of REST Error Handling:

- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Clear mapping to HTTP protocol semantics.
  - Easy integration with HTTP-based tools.
- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Limited to HTTP semantics; lacks granularity in complex scenarios.

### ⚡ GraphQL: Structured Errors Field

#### ✅ Key Concepts:

- GraphQL returns errors in a **structured `errors` field** within the response, allowing both **data** and **error information** to be delivered together.
- Supports **partial success** where part of the query can succeed while other parts fail.
- Allows **custom error extensions** for additional context.

#### 📜 Example: GraphQL Error Response

##### 🔄 Query:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "99") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User not found",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["user"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
        "httpStatus": 404
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ⚙️ Partial Success Handling:

If part of the query is valid, GraphQL returns available data alongside errors for invalid fields.

##### 📜 Example: Partial Success Query

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    nonExistentField # Invalid field
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": { "name": "Alice" }
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Cannot query field 'nonExistentField' on type 'User'.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 4, "column": 5 }],
      "path": ["user", "nonExistentField"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🔒 Handling Validation and Authentication Errors

#### 🛡 REST Example: Authentication Error

```javascript
app.get("/secure-data", (req, res) => {
  if (!req.headers.authorization) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      error: "Unauthorized access",
      code: 401,
    });
  }
  res.json({ data: "Secure data content" });
});
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized access",
  "code": 401
}
```

#### ⚡ GraphQL Example: Authentication Error

```graphql
query {
  secureData {
    content
  }
}
```

##### 📝 Response:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Unauthorized access",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
        "httpStatus": 401
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 📝 Key Differences Recap

| **Error Granularity** | Limited to HTTP codes           | Highly granular with custom extensions  |
| **Response Format**   | Separate for each endpoint      | Unified response with data and errors   |

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **REST** provides a **simple**, **standardized** approach to error handling, ideal for straightforward APIs.
- **GraphQL** offers **rich, structured error responses** that enhance debugging and support **partial success**, making it ideal for complex, client-driven applications.

Understanding these differences is vital for designing APIs that deliver **robust error feedback**, ensuring a seamless **developer experience** and **efficient debugging processes**.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

Security is a crucial aspect of any API architecture. While both **REST** and **GraphQL** offer robust security mechanisms, their approaches differ significantly. This section explores the key security considerations for both paradigms, complete with **code snippets** and **practical insights**.

### 🛡 Authentication & Authorization

#### 🌿 REST: Token-Based Authentication (JWT) & OAuth Flows

REST commonly uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** and **OAuth** for managing authentication and authorization.

##### 📜 Example: JWT Authentication in REST (Node.js with Express)

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const secretKey = "your_secret_key";

app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  const user = { id: 1, username: "Alice" };
  const token = jwt.sign(user, secretKey, { expiresIn: "1h" });
  res.json({ token });
});

const authenticateJWT = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];
  if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);
  jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};

app.get("/secure-data", authenticateJWT, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ data: "Secure content" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("REST API running on port 3000"));
```

##### 📝 Key Insights:

- **JWT** allows **stateless authentication**, ideal for distributed systems.
- **OAuth** is commonly used for third-party integrations, providing **token-based access**.

#### ⚡ GraphQL: Field-Level Authorization & Custom Resolvers

GraphQL provides **fine-grained control** by allowing **field-level authorization** and **custom authentication resolvers**.

##### 📜 Example: Authentication in GraphQL with Apollo Server

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require("apollo-server");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

const secretKey = "your_secret_key";

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    secureData: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    secureData: (parent, args, context) => {
      if (!context.user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
      return "Secure content";
    },
  },
};

const getUser = (token) => {
  try {
    return jwt.verify(token, secretKey);
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: ({ req }) => {
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];
    const user = getUser(token);
    return { user };
  },
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => console.log(`GraphQL API running at ${url}`));
```

##### 📝 Key Insights:

- **Field-level control** ensures only authorized users access sensitive fields.
- **Custom resolvers** provide flexible authentication workflows.

### 🔒 Preventing Common Vulnerabilities

#### 🌿 REST: Securing Endpoints & Rate-Limiting

- **Endpoint security:** Use **HTTPS**, **input validation**, and **CORS policies**.
- **Rate-limiting:** Prevents **brute force** and **denial-of-service (DoS)** attacks.

##### 📜 Example: Rate Limiting with Express-Rate-Limit

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(limiter);
```

#### ⚡ GraphQL: Query Depth Limiting & Complexity Analysis

GraphQL’s **flexible query structure** can be exploited for **resource-intensive operations**. Mitigation strategies include:

- **Query depth limiting:** Restricts query depth to prevent nested attacks.
- **Complexity analysis:** Estimates and limits the cost of query execution.

##### 📜 Example: Depth Limiting with graphql-depth-limit

```javascript
const depthLimit = require("graphql-depth-limit");

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  validationRules: [depthLimit(5)], // Maximum depth: 5
});
```

##### 📜 Example: Complexity Analysis with graphql-query-complexity

```javascript
const { createComplexityLimitRule } = require("graphql-validation-complexity");

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  validationRules: [
    createComplexityLimitRule(1000, {
      onCost: (cost) => console.log("Query cost:", cost),
    }),
  ],
});
```
