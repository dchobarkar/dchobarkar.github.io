pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GasOptimizedStorage {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;

    function setBalance(uint256 _amount) external {
        balances[msg.sender] = _amount; // Mapping ensures O(1) complexity
    }

    function getBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[msg.sender];
    }
}
```

🔹 **Mapping data structures** optimize gas costs by enabling **constant-time lookups** and eliminating unnecessary storage reads.

### 📌 2️⃣ Smart Contract Security: Eliminating Attack Vectors

Given the **immutable** nature of smart contracts, security vulnerabilities pose significant risks. Adopting **defensive programming paradigms** ensures exploit-resistant contract execution.

#### 🔹 Mitigating Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

✅ **Reentrancy Attacks:** Implement **state-modifying mutexes** to prevent recursive function calls.  
✅ **Integer Overflows & Underflows:** Enforce **Solidity’s SafeMath library** or native arithmetic checks (`>=0.8.0`).  
✅ **Front-Running Resistance:** Integrate **commit-reveal cryptographic schemes** and **transaction ordering protection (EIP-1559 gas pricing)**.
✅ **Access Control Measures:** Implement **role-based access control** using **OpenZeppelin’s Ownable contract**.  
✅ **Use Time-Locked Transactions:** Delay high-value or admin-level transactions with **time locks** to allow time for intervention if needed.

#### 🔹 Example: Secure Solidity Contract Against Reentrancy

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SecureContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
    bool private locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "Reentrancy detected!");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external noReentrant {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

🔹 This contract **prevents reentrancy** by utilizing a **lock flag (`locked`)**, ensuring atomic function execution.

### 📌 3️⃣ Enhancing User Experience (UX): Streamlining Blockchain Interactions

To drive dApp adoption, UX optimizations should **simplify user transactions, minimize cognitive load, and improve transparency**.

#### 🔹 UX Best Practices for Seamless dApp Interactions

✅ **Transaction Simulation:** Utilize **Tenderly, Flashbots**, or local test environments to **preview execution outcomes**, reducing transaction failures.
✅ **Optimistic UI Rendering:** Display **immediate user feedback** before transaction finality, reducing perceived latency.
✅ **Progress Indicators:** Inform users of estimated transaction processing times, improving transparency.
✅ **Pre-Signed Transactions:** Utilize **off-chain signed transactions** where possible to improve UX and minimize gas costs.

#### 🔹 Example: Implementing Gasless Transactions Using Ethers.js

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

async function sendGaslessTransaction(
  userAddress,
  contract,
  functionName,
  args
) {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
    "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
  );
  const relayer = new ethers.Wallet("YOUR_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY", provider);

  const tx = await contract.populateTransaction[functionName](...args);
  tx.from = userAddress;

  const response = await relayer.sendTransaction(tx);
  console.log("Gasless Transaction Sent:", response.hash);
}
```

🔹 **Meta-transactions** abstract gas fee complexities, facilitating **seamless blockchain interactions**.

### 📌 4️⃣ Scalability Strategies: Leveraging Layer 2 Solutions

✅ **Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zkSync, StarkNet):** Compress transaction data via **cryptographic proofs**, ensuring enhanced privacy.  
✅ **Polygon Supernets:** Facilitate high-speed, customizable **Ethereum sidechains** for enterprise-grade dApps.  
✅ **Validium Solutions:** Hybrid zk-Rollups with **off-chain data availability**, ensuring scalability with enhanced security.

#### 🔹 Example: Deploying Smart Contracts on Arbitrum

Modify `hardhat.config.js` to enable **Arbitrum deployment**:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    arbitrum: {
      url: "https://arb-mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID",
      accounts: ["0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"],
    },
  },
  solidity: "0.8.0",
};
```

Deploy via Hardhat:

```bash
