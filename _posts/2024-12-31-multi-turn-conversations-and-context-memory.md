# Conversational AI: Building Intelligent Chatbots Across Platforms - 04: Multi-Turn Conversations and Context Memory

## üß† Why Context Matters in Conversational AI

In the previous article, we built a basic website chatbot using OpenAI and LangChain. It could generate responses based on the user's latest input, but every message was treated in isolation. Ask it your name in one message, then refer to ‚Äúme‚Äù in the next ‚Äî it wouldn't remember a thing. That‚Äôs because it lacked **memory**.

This limitation becomes immediately obvious to users. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the first signs of whether a chatbot is truly intelligent or just a glorified autocomplete.

### ü§Ø The Illusion of Intelligence

Modern LLMs (like GPT-4) are trained on billions of tokens. They‚Äôre surprisingly good at pattern recognition and natural language generation. But when deployed naively, they don‚Äôt _actually_ retain anything between messages. Each API call is stateless unless we explicitly build context into the request.

Without context:

```txt
User: My name is Darshan.
Bot: Nice to meet you, Darshan!
User: What's my name?
Bot: I'm not sure who you are.
```

With memory-enabled context:

```txt
User: My name is Darshan.
Bot: Nice to meet you, Darshan!
User: What's my name?
Bot: You said your name is Darshan.
```

See the difference? The second experience feels human. It feels _alive_. That's the power of memory.

### üß© Single-Turn vs Multi-Turn Bots

Let‚Äôs draw a clear distinction:

- **Single-turn chatbot**: Handles one message at a time with no awareness of prior interactions.
- **Multi-turn chatbot**: Maintains some form of memory or history across the session.

A multi-turn bot enables:

- Following up with ‚Äúwhat do you mean by that?‚Äù
- Remembering and referencing names, preferences, prior answers
- Complex tasks split across multiple steps
- Personalized and emotionally coherent conversations

And these are not just UX perks ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential in domains like:

- üõí E-commerce (‚ÄúShow me what I looked at yesterday‚Äù)
- üßæ Customer support (‚ÄúMy last ticket was about my order #1234‚Äù)
- üß≥ Travel and booking (‚ÄúI want to go to Paris again next summer‚Äù)

### üí° What Context _Actually_ Means for LLMs

Now let‚Äôs get technical. When we say ‚Äúcontext‚Äù in LLM-land, we‚Äôre talking about the **input prompt**. LLMs like GPT-3.5/4 don‚Äôt have memory across API calls. If you want them to _remember_, you need to include that memory in the next prompt.

That means **you are responsible for feeding prior messages** into each interaction. LangChain and similar libraries automate this for us by managing message history, summarizing it, or injecting structured memory.

There are three main ways to provide context:

1. **Full chat history** (e.g. using `ConversationBufferMemory`)
2. **Summarized history** (e.g. using `ConversationSummaryMemory`)
3. **Structured memory** (e.g. using `EntityMemory` or vector stores)

We‚Äôll be exploring all three in this article.

But before that, here‚Äôs a visual breakdown of how stateless vs stateful bots behave:

```plaintext
User        Stateless Bot         Stateful Bot
------------------------------------------------
Hi          ‚Üí Hi!                 ‚Üí Hi, welcome back!
My name is D‚Üí Hello D!            ‚Üí Hello Darshan!
Who am I?   ‚Üí I don't know        ‚Üí You're Darshan
```

### üöÄ What's Next

In the upcoming sections, we‚Äôll plug memory into our existing chatbot project. No more dumb replies. We‚Äôll teach it to remember user names, summarize prior chats, and even recall vectorized memories from Supabase ‚Äî all with LangChain‚Äôs free tooling.

Let‚Äôs start by exploring the **different types of memory** we can integrate ‚Äî and when to use which.

## üß© Types of Memory in LangChain (Free & Practical)

LangChain offers several built-in memory modules ‚Äî each designed for a different flavor of "context". The best part? They're **free to use**, built into the open-source LangChain core, and work seamlessly with OpenAI‚Äôs free-tier API access (as long as you're within token limits).

Let‚Äôs go through them one by one.

### 1. üß† `ConversationBufferMemory`

This is the simplest memory type: it stores the **entire conversation history** as a plain buffer and injects it into the prompt with every turn.

#### ‚úÖ Use When

- Your conversations are short
- You want full transparency into the chat history

#### ‚ùå Avoid When

- The conversation gets long (token limit issues)

#### Code Example (Node.js + LangChain)

```ts
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { ConversationChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { ConversationBufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  temperature: 0.7,
  openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const memory = new ConversationBufferMemory();

const chain = new ConversationChain({
  llm: model,
  memory,
});

const res1 = await chain.call({ input: "Hi, I'm Darshan." });
console.log(res1);

const res2 = await chain.call({ input: "What did I just say?" });
console.log(res2);
```

üëâ This will result in a conversation where the model knows the entire prior history, just like a real human would.

### 2. üßæ `ConversationSummaryMemory`

Instead of passing the entire history, this memory keeps a **running summary**. It summarizes the conversation every few messages and passes only that to the LLM.

#### ‚úÖ Use When

- Conversations are long or detailed
- You need to stay under token limits

#### Code Example

```ts
import { ConversationSummaryMemory } from "langchain/memory";

const memory = new ConversationSummaryMemory({
  llm: model,
});

const chain = new ConversationChain({
  llm: model,
  memory,
});
```

You can inspect the summary like this:

```ts
console.log(await memory.loadMemoryVariables());
```

This will show the auto-generated summary being passed as context.

### 3. üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `EntityMemory`

This type of memory tracks **specific entities** mentioned in the conversation ‚Äî like names, places, dates, and custom terms.

#### ‚úÖ Use When

- You need to remember structured data from the user
- Building something like a booking or assistant bot

#### Code Example

```ts
import { ConversationEntityMemory } from "langchain/memory";

const memory = new ConversationEntityMemory({
  llm: model,
  entityTypes: ["name", "location"], // optional
});

const chain = new ConversationChain({
  llm: model,
  memory,
});
```

This memory will automatically track entity mentions and reuse them when needed.

### 4. üì¶ Vector Store Memory (Long-Term)

This is where things get powerful. Instead of relying on short-term memory, you can store past interactions as **embeddings** and perform semantic searches over them. Great for FAQs, past sessions, or support transcripts.

We‚Äôll cover the full implementation in Topic 6, but here‚Äôs a preview using `Chroma` (free + local):

#### Code Preview

```ts
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/memory";
import { Chroma } from "langchain/vectorstores/chroma";

const vectorStore = await Chroma.fromTexts(
  ["User likes dark mode", "User bought sneakers last time"],
  embeddings
);

const memory = new MemoryVectorStore({
  vectorStore,
  memoryKey: "long_term_memory",
});
```

This lets you retrieve semantically similar conversations or preferences without explicitly recalling them.

### üß† Quick Comparison Table

| Memory Type           | Strengths                     | Weaknesses               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `BufferMemory`        | Full history, easy to debug   | Token bloat              |
| `SummaryMemory`       | Token-efficient, readable     | Can lose nuance          |
| `EntityMemory`        | Great for structured info     | Needs prompt tuning      |
| `Vector Store Memory` | Scalable, long-term, semantic | Requires embedding setup |

### ü§î When to Use What

```ts
if (session.isShort) use(ConversationBufferMemory);
else if (session.isLong && compressible) use(ConversationSummaryMemory);
else if (needsStructuredData) use(EntityMemory);
else if (needsPersistentRecall) use(VectorStoreMemory);
```

Up next, we‚Äôll modify our existing website chatbot to use `ConversationBufferMemory` and see it handle back-and-forth context with ease üí¨

## üí¨ Integrating `ConversationBufferMemory` into Our Web Chatbot

In this section, we‚Äôll enhance the chatbot we built in Article 3 by giving it memory ‚Äî specifically, `ConversationBufferMemory` from LangChain. This will allow our chatbot to remember past messages during a session and respond with continuity. üß†

We‚Äôll update both the **backend** (LangChain logic) and the **frontend** (Next.js chat UI).

### üõ† Backend: Enhancing the Chat API Route

Let‚Äôs say we already have an API route at `pages/api/chat.ts` or in an Express backend.

#### ‚úÖ Updated Code for Chat API with Memory

```ts
// lib/chatWithMemory.ts
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { ConversationChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { ConversationBufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";

const memoryMap = new Map<string, ConversationChain>();

export const getChainForSession = (sessionId: string) => {
  if (memoryMap.has(sessionId)) return memoryMap.get(sessionId)!;

  const memory = new ConversationBufferMemory();

  const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
    temperature: 0.7,
  });

  const chain = new ConversationChain({ llm: model, memory });
  memoryMap.set(sessionId, chain);

  return chain;
};
```

Now let‚Äôs use it in the API route:

```ts
// pages/api/chat.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { getChainForSession } from "../../lib/chatWithMemory";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { input, sessionId } = req.body;

  if (!input || !sessionId)
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing input or sessionId" });

  try {
    const chain = getChainForSession(sessionId);
    const response = await chain.call({ input });
    res.status(200).json({ response: response.response });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Chat error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Something went wrong" });
  }
}
```

üîÅ Here, we‚Äôre storing one `ConversationChain` per `sessionId` in a memory map (works well for dev). For production, this can be stored in Redis, a database, or a serverless memory layer.

### üßë‚Äçüé§ Frontend: Keeping Track of Session ID and Chat History

On the client-side, we need to persist a `sessionId` across the chat session.

```ts
// utils/session.ts
export const getSessionId = () => {
  let id = localStorage.getItem("chat_session_id");
  if (!id) {
    id = crypto.randomUUID();
    localStorage.setItem("chat_session_id", id);
  }
  return id;
};
```

Then use this in your frontend chat component:

```ts
// components/ChatBox.tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { getSessionId } from "../utils/session";

const ChatBox = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const sessionId = getSessionId();

  const sendMessage = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/chat", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ input, sessionId }),
    });

    const data = await res.json();
    setMessages((msgs) => [...msgs, `You: ${input}`, `Bot: ${data.response}`]);
    setInput("");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="chat-window">
        {messages.map((msg, idx) => (
          <p key={idx}>{msg}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
      <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChatBox;
```

### üéØ What You Achieve

With this setup:

- Each user has a unique session that remembers their past inputs
- Your backend maintains context automatically with `ConversationBufferMemory`
- The bot will now respond like:

```txt
User: Hi, I‚Äôm Darshan.
Bot: Hi Darshan! How can I help you today?
User: What‚Äôs my name?
Bot: You said your name is Darshan.
```

### üö® Limitations of `ConversationBufferMemory`

- The full chat history gets appended to every prompt ‚Äî token limits become a concern
- No summarization or pruning built-in
- Great for short-lived sessions (like live chat), not for persistent memory

Up next, we‚Äôll explore `SummaryMemory` ‚Äî a smarter way to compress context and scale conversations without losing track üí°

## üßæ Upgrading to `SummaryMemory`: Scalable Context Compression

As your chatbot‚Äôs conversations grow, `ConversationBufferMemory` quickly hits limitations. Every message is included in the prompt, bloating token usage and slowing down responses. That's where `ConversationSummaryMemory` comes in ‚Äî it compresses past exchanges into a concise summary üß†üìÑ.

This section walks you through swapping out `BufferMemory` with `SummaryMemory` in your LangChain chatbot.

### ü§ñ What is `ConversationSummaryMemory`?

It‚Äôs a memory class that uses the LLM to summarize the chat history periodically. Instead of dumping all past messages, it keeps a **dynamic, evolving summary** that gets injected into each prompt.

You can think of it as giving your bot the ability to **‚Äúkeep notes‚Äù** instead of remembering every word.

### üîß Backend: Refactor to Use Summary Memory

Let‚Äôs update our memory module in `lib/chatWithMemory.ts`.

#### Step 1: Import `ConversationSummaryMemory`

```ts
import { ConversationSummaryMemory } from "langchain/memory";
```

#### Step 2: Replace Memory Creation Logic

```ts
export const getChainForSession = (sessionId: string) => {
  if (memoryMap.has(sessionId)) return memoryMap.get(sessionId)!;

  const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
    temperature: 0.7,
    modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  });

  const memory = new ConversationSummaryMemory({
    llm: model,
    memoryKey: "chat_history",
    returnMessages: true,
  });

  const chain = new ConversationChain({ llm: model, memory });
  memoryMap.set(sessionId, chain);
  return chain;
};
```

üìå Note: We use the same model (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) to generate summaries, so it stays within the free tier as long as you control message volume.

### üß™ Debug: View the Evolving Summary

To see what your bot ‚Äúremembers‚Äù:

```ts
const variables = await memory.loadMemoryVariables();
console.log("Summary:", variables.chat_history);
```

You‚Äôll get output like:

```txt
"The user introduced themselves as Darshan. They asked about chatbot memory."
```

This is what gets sent as context in future prompts!

### üß† Prompt Inspection Example

LangChain internally injects this summary as:

```txt
Previous conversation summary:
The user introduced themselves as Darshan. They asked about chatbot memory.
Current input:
What should I use for long-term recall?
```

This is lean, efficient, and ideal for longer conversations or slower clients (like WhatsApp bots).

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- Reduces token usage dramatically
- Makes context scalable
- Provides human-readable memory

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The summarization is lossy ‚Äî details might be omitted
- Requires good prompt tuning for accuracy
- Can be biased toward early conversation turns

### üß≠ When to Use

Use `SummaryMemory` when:

- Your bot needs to support long or meandering sessions
- You want efficient, compressible state
- Token costs or latency are becoming a concern

### üîÑ Optional: Fallback to Buffer for First Few Turns

To give summaries some initial substance, you can combine both:

```ts
const hybridMemory = new BufferWindowMemory({
  k: 5,
  returnMessages: true,
  memoryKey: "chat_history",
});
```

And wrap it with summary after a few turns. We'll cover hybrid models in further topic.

Next up: let‚Äôs teach our bot how to **remember names, places, and structured info** using `EntityMemory` üè∑Ô∏è

## üè∑Ô∏è Adding `EntityMemory`: Remembering Names, Dates, and More

If you want your chatbot to remember **structured information** like a user‚Äôs name, favorite color, travel destinations, or booked dates ‚Äî `EntityMemory` is the way to go. This memory type allows your bot to extract and retain entities from the conversation, giving it the illusion of ‚Äúfilling slots‚Äù like classic rule-based assistants ‚Äî but powered by LLMs.

In this section, we‚Äôll upgrade our chatbot to recognize and recall entities with `ConversationEntityMemory`. üí°

### üß† What is `EntityMemory` in LangChain?

LangChain‚Äôs `ConversationEntityMemory` uses the LLM to identify and store named entities automatically during a conversation. It creates a key-value store (under the hood) that persists structured information per session.

### üõ† Backend: Integrate `EntityMemory`

Let‚Äôs update our `lib/chatWithMemory.ts` to use `ConversationEntityMemory`.

#### Step 1: Install dependency (if needed)

This comes with core LangChain, no extra package required.

#### Step 2: Import and Initialize Entity Memory

```ts
import { ConversationEntityMemory } from "langchain/memory";
```

#### Step 3: Modify `getChainForSession`

```ts
export const getChainForSession = (sessionId: string) => {
  if (memoryMap.has(sessionId)) return memoryMap.get(sessionId)!;

  const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
    temperature: 0.7,
  });

  const memory = new ConversationEntityMemory({
    llm: model,
    memoryKey: "chat_history",
    returnMessages: true,
  });

  const chain = new ConversationChain({
    llm: model,
    memory,
  });

  memoryMap.set(sessionId, chain);
  return chain;
};
```

This memory will now track entities like `name`, `destination`, `date`, etc., and inject them into prompts.

### üß™ Test the Entity Extraction

Let‚Äôs test the memory with:

```txt
User: My name is Darshan.
Bot: Nice to meet you, Darshan.
User: What‚Äôs my name?
Bot: You said your name is Darshan.
```

Or:

```txt
User: I want to fly from Mumbai to Goa on May 18.
Bot: Got it. Booking a flight from Mumbai to Goa on May 18.
User: Remind me where I‚Äôm going.
Bot: You‚Äôre flying from Mumbai to Goa.
```

### üßº Inspecting Stored Entities

Want to see what‚Äôs stored? Just inspect:

```ts
const variables = await memory.loadMemoryVariables();
console.log("Entities:", variables);
```

It will look like:

```json
{
  chat_history: [ ... ],
  entities: {
    name: "Darshan",
    origin: "Mumbai",
    destination: "Goa",
    date: "May 18"
  }
}
```

### üß© Use Case: Travel Assistant Bot

With `EntityMemory`, your bot can:

- Ask for missing entities (‚ÄúWhere are you flying to?‚Äù)
- Reuse filled slots (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre heading to Goa on May 18‚Äù)
- Clarify ambiguous turns (‚ÄúDid you mean this May or next?‚Äù)

This makes `EntityMemory` a great fit for:

- Booking flows (flights, hotels, events)
- Appointment scheduling
- Preference tracking (e.g., favorite genres)

### üß† Memory Comparison

| Feature         | BufferMemory   | SummaryMemory   | EntityMemory         |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Retains history | Full text      | Compressed text | Key-value entities   |
| Token usage     | High           | Low             | Minimal              |
| Best for        | Back-and-forth | Long chats      | Structured info bots |

### üõë Limitations

- Entity extraction depends on the LLM‚Äôs accuracy
- You may need to guide it with instructions (few-shot prompts)
- Entities are overwritten unless you manually merge

### üß≠ Next: Long-Term Memory with Vector Embeddings

So far, all memory types are session-based. In the next topic, we‚Äôll explore how to create **persistent memory** using a free vector store like Supabase ‚Äî so your bot can recall past chats, FAQs, and even support cases. üöÄ

## üß† Storing Long-Term Memory with Supabase Vector Store

So far, our chatbot has been storing context **in-memory**, scoped to a session. But what if we want it to remember things **across sessions** ‚Äî like a user‚Äôs past chats, preferences, or support tickets? That‚Äôs where **vector stores** come in. üß¨

In this topic, we‚Äôll integrate **Supabase** (free tier) with LangChain to store and retrieve long-term semantic memory using vector embeddings.

### üß¨ What is Vector Memory?

Instead of storing plain text, we convert each message or interaction into a vector (embedding) and store it. Later, we can **semantically search** that data:

> ‚ÄúShow me what the user talked about last time‚Äù ‚Üí retrieves relevant past message based on meaning.

Perfect for:

- Remembering user preferences across sessions
- Recalling FAQs or help topics
- Building personal assistants that evolve over time

### üß∞ Tools We‚Äôll Use

- LangChain (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL with pgvector)
- `@supabase/supabase-js` + `langchain/vectorstores/supabase`
- OpenAI for embeddings (or use `open-source models` later)

### üõ† Step-by-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Set Up Supabase with pgvector

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), create a free project
2. In the SQL editor, run:

   ```sql
   create extension if not exists vector;
   ```

3. Then create the table:

   ```sql
   create table documents (
     id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
     content text,
     embedding vector(1536)
   );
   ```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js langchain openai
```

#### Step 3: Initialize Supabase Client

```ts
// lib/supabaseClient.ts
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

export const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
```

#### Step 4: Setup Vector Store with LangChain

```ts
// lib/vectorStore.ts
import { SupabaseVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/supabase";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
import { supabase } from "./supabaseClient";

export const initVectorStore = async () => {
  return await SupabaseVectorStore.fromExistingIndex(new OpenAIEmbeddings(), {
    client: supabase,
    tableName: "documents",
    queryName: "match_documents",
  });
};
```

#### Step 5: Store and Query Embeddings

```ts
import { initVectorStore } from "./vectorStore";

const store = await initVectorStore();

// To store
await store.addDocuments([{ pageContent: "User likes minimal UI" }]);

// To query
const results = await store.similaritySearch("What UI does the user like?", 1);
console.log(results);
```

### üßë‚Äçüíª Use Case in Chatbot

Imagine you want your chatbot to recall previous chats:

```ts
const pastMemories = await store.similaritySearch(userQuery, 3);
const context = pastMemories.map((doc) => doc.pageContent).join("\n");

const chain = new ConversationChain({
  llm: model,
  prompt: `Previously you said: \n${context}\nNow respond to: {input}`,
});
```

This lets the bot personalize responses based on prior conversations, even weeks later. üß†‚ú®

### üìå Tips for Vector Memory

- Use it **with** short-term memory for best results (hybrid model)
- Clean or compress stored messages to reduce cost
- You can add metadata (userId, timestamp) in Supabase rows

### üõë Limitations

- Embedding queries are semantic, not exact (results are approximate)
- Vector size must match model output (e.g., 1536 for OpenAI)
- Free Supabase tier has some limits on storage/querying speed

### üß≠ What‚Äôs Next

Now that we have short-term, entity, and long-term memory working, the next step is to **combine these memory types intelligently**. We‚Äôll do that in **Topic 7: Combining Multiple Memories in One Bot** ü§ñüîÄ

## ü§ñ Combining Multiple Memories in One Bot

So far, we've used different memory types ‚Äî buffer, summary, entity, and vector ‚Äî each excelling in different contexts. But real-world bots often need to **blend multiple memory strategies together** for maximum intelligence.

In this section, we‚Äôll show how to:

- Combine short-term memory (Buffer/Summary)
- Track structured entities (EntityMemory)
- Retrieve long-term data (Vector Store)
- Route memory inputs efficiently üß†‚û°Ô∏èüõ†Ô∏è

### üéØ Why Combine Memories?

Each memory solves a different problem:

- **Buffer**: Keeps immediate history
- **Summary**: Compresses context over time
- **Entity**: Extracts structured info
- **Vector**: Enables persistent, scalable recall

Together, they can create a truly **contextual and personalized** bot.

### üõ† Full Example: Hybrid Memory Architecture

We‚Äôll build a chain that:

1. Retrieves relevant vector memories
2. Tracks structured entities
3. Maintains recent chat history

Let‚Äôs build the logic step-by-step ‚§µÔ∏è

#### Step 1: Set Up All Memories

```ts
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { ConversationChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { ConversationBufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";
import { ConversationEntityMemory } from "langchain/memory";
import { SupabaseVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/supabase";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
import { supabase } from "./supabaseClient";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
  temperature: 0.7,
});

const bufferMemory = new ConversationBufferMemory({
  memoryKey: "chat_history",
  returnMessages: true,
});

const entityMemory = new ConversationEntityMemory({
  llm: model,
  memoryKey: "entities",
  returnMessages: true,
});

const vectorStore = await SupabaseVectorStore.fromExistingIndex(
  new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
  {
    client: supabase,
    tableName: "documents",
    queryName: "match_documents",
  }
);
```

#### Step 2: Define Hybrid Chain with Injected Memories

We manually build a prompt that uses all memory types:

```ts
const vectorResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
  "what do you remember about me?",
  3
);
const longTermContext = vectorResults.map((v) => v.pageContent).join("\n");

const customPrompt = `
Long-term memory:
${longTermContext}

Chat history:
{chat_history}

Known entities:
{entities}

User: {input}
AI:`;

const chain = new ConversationChain({
  llm: model,
  prompt: customPrompt,
  memory: {
    loadMemoryVariables: async (_) => {
      const history = await bufferMemory.loadMemoryVariables();
      const entities = await entityMemory.loadMemoryVariables();
      return {
        ...history,
        ...entities,
      };
    },
    saveContext: async (inputs, outputs) => {
      await bufferMemory.saveContext(inputs, outputs);
      await entityMemory.saveContext(inputs, outputs);
    },
    clear: async () => {
      await bufferMemory.clear();
      await entityMemory.clear();
    },
  },
});
```

With this setup, your bot:

- Looks up semantic memories from Supabase
- Injects tracked user data like names, dates
- Keeps recent turns handy

### üîÑ Frontend Reminder: Persist Session ID

Ensure your frontend sends a `sessionId` that stays consistent so you can associate memory with users.

```ts
// utils/session.ts
export const getSessionId = () => {
  let id = localStorage.getItem("chat_session_id");
  if (!id) {
    id = crypto.randomUUID();
    localStorage.setItem("chat_session_id", id);
  }
  return id;
};
```

Use this to tie vector memories to sessions or user IDs in Supabase metadata.

### üõë Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Token explosion**: Too many memory sources can bloat prompts
- **Redundancy**: Same info may appear in multiple memories
- **Conflicts**: Entity memory may contradict vector recall

Use pruning and weight your prompt sections based on recency/importance.

### üß≠ What‚Äôs Next

You now have a **multi-memory intelligent bot** ‚Äî congrats! üß†üí° Next, we‚Äôll learn how to **debug and inspect memory** live to ensure things work correctly. That‚Äôs up next in **Topic 8: Debugging and Visualizing Memory** üîç

## üîç Debugging and Visualizing Memory in Your Chatbot

Once you‚Äôve wired in multiple memory modules, it becomes critical to know **what your bot remembers** ‚Äî and what it doesn‚Äôt. Otherwise, you‚Äôre stuck in the dark when it hallucinates, forgets something, or repeats itself.

In this section, we‚Äôll:

- Inspect memory states in real time
- Create developer tools to visualize memory
- Catch common bugs like memory overwrite and token bloat

### üß™ View Memory Internals with LangChain

Each memory class supports `loadMemoryVariables()` to show its current state.

#### Example: View Buffer Memory

```ts
const historyVars = await bufferMemory.loadMemoryVariables();
console.log("Buffer Memory:", historyVars);
```

#### Example: View Entity Memory

```ts
const entityVars = await entityMemory.loadMemoryVariables();
console.log("Entity Memory:", entityVars);
```

#### Example: View Vector Matches

```ts
const pastMemories = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("What do I prefer?", 3);
pastMemories.forEach((doc) => console.log("Vector Match:", doc.pageContent));
```

These allow you to see what‚Äôs being injected into the prompt ‚Äî a crucial step for testing.

### üñ•Ô∏è Build a Developer Debug Panel (Optional UI)

You can expose memory data in the frontend for live debugging.

```ts
// pages/api/debug.ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { sessionId } = req.query;
  const chain = getChainForSession(sessionId);

  const buffer = await chain.memory.bufferMemory.loadMemoryVariables();
  const entity = await chain.memory.entityMemory.loadMemoryVariables();

  res.json({ buffer, entity });
}
```

Then call it from your frontend:

```ts
const res = await fetch(`/api/debug?sessionId=${sessionId}`);
const { buffer, entity } = await res.json();
console.log("Buffer", buffer);
console.log("Entity", entity);
```

Display it in a collapsible panel beside your chat UI for in-dev use only.

### üö® Common Bugs and Fixes

#### 1. üß® Memory Not Updating

**Cause**: Forgot to call `saveContext()` manually when using custom memory.

**Fix**:

```ts
await memory.saveContext({ input }, { response });
```

#### 2. üåÄ Token Explosion in Buffer

**Cause**: `ConversationBufferMemory` grows too large

**Fix**:

- Switch to `ConversationSummaryMemory`
- Or prune messages after N turns

#### 3. üßä Entity Memory Overwriting

**Cause**: The same entity name is extracted multiple times with different values

**Fix**:

- Add a review step in UI (‚ÄúIs this correct?‚Äù)
- Store old entities separately if needed

#### 4. ‚öñÔ∏è Conflicts Between Memories

**Cause**: Vector and entity memory contradict

**Fix**:

- Prioritize one over the other in prompt
- Log memory source per variable

### üß† Logging Middleware (Node.js)

Create a logging wrapper around the memory chain:

```ts
const memoryLogger = async (inputs, outputs, memory) => {
  const state = await memory.loadMemoryVariables();
  console.log("\n\n[DEBUG] Current Memory State:");
  console.dir(state, { depth: null });
  console.log("\nInput:", inputs.input);
  console.log("Output:", outputs.response);
};
```

Call this after every interaction for live inspection.

### üßº Test Memory Persistence Across Sessions

Use a test script to ensure:

- Vector memory survives restarts
- Entity memory doesn‚Äôt reset (if using external cache)

```ts
const session1 = getChainForSession("test123");
await session1.call({ input: "My name is Darshan." });

const session2 = getChainForSession("test123");
const response = await session2.call({ input: "What's my name?" });
console.log(response);
```

### üì¶ Tip: Store Logs in Supabase for Review

You can log each conversation, memory state, and LLM response into Supabase (or any DB) to create a debug dashboard.

Table schema:

```sql
create table logs (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  session_id text,
  input text,
  output text,
  memory jsonb,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
```

### ‚úÖ Recap: Why Debugging Memory Matters

Memory-driven bots behave **emergently**. A small bug in memory logic can:

- Break personalization
- Cause hallucinations
- Lead to hard-to-track logic errors

Always inspect and log memory ‚Äî especially in production environments.

Next up: we'll cover **best practices for memory hygiene**, privacy, pruning, and long-term strategies for production bots in **Topic 9** üßΩüßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

## üßΩ Best Practices and Gotchas for Chatbot Memory

You‚Äôve now built a smart, context-aware, memory-powered chatbot. But before shipping it to production, let‚Äôs go over the real-world concerns ‚Äî from privacy and data safety to memory hygiene and performance tuning.

This final section outlines **battle-tested practices**, common traps, and design tips to keep your bot fast, ethical, and maintainable. üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è

### üßº 1. Prune or Summarize Memory Regularly

**Problem**: Memory grows indefinitely ‚Üí token bloat, degraded performance

#### ‚úÖ Strategy

- Use `ConversationSummaryMemory` after 5‚Äì10 turns
- Apply windowed buffer memory:

```ts
const memory = new BufferWindowMemory({ k: 5 });
```

- Periodically summarize old chunks and replace them

#### Optional Auto-Summarization

```ts
if (memory.length > 10) {
  const summary = await summarizer.call({ input: fullChat });
  memory = [summary];
}
```

### üîê 2. Handle User Data Responsibly

If your bot is storing names, locations, or preferences:

- Encrypt at rest (e.g., Supabase row-level encryption)
- Avoid logging PII in plain text
- Provide users an option to clear memory:

#### API: Clear Memory

```ts
app.post("/api/clear-memory", async (req, res) => {
  const chain = getChainForSession(req.body.sessionId);
  await chain.memory.clear();
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

- Respect `sessionId` scoping ‚Äî don‚Äôt leak memory across users!

### ‚è≥ 3. Optimize Token Usage in Prompts

Memory-heavy bots = higher latency and cost

#### Tips

- Always use compressed formats (summary > buffer)
- Don‚Äôt inject unchanged vector memory every time
- Remove verbose text ("Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that")

You can test prompt length via:

```ts
import { getTokenCount } from "langchain/utils";
const tokenCount = getTokenCount(finalPrompt);
```

### üß† 4. Choose Memory by Use Case

| Scenario                     | Best Memory Strategy         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Short chat, rich detail      | BufferMemory                 |
| Long chat, lean context      | SummaryMemory                |
| Forms, booking flows         | EntityMemory                 |
| Persistent history           | VectorStoreMemory (Supabase) |
| Multi-channel, multi-session | Hybrid + external database   |

### üõ† 5. Use Middleware to Intercept Memory

Hook into every turn for:

- Logging
- Redaction (strip phone numbers, emails)
- Analytics

```ts
chain.middleware = async (inputs, outputs) => {
  const cleanInput = sanitize(inputs.input);
  logInteraction({ sessionId, input: cleanInput, output: outputs.response });
};
```

### üß± 6. Modularize Memory Components

Keep each memory implementation in its own module:

```bash
/lib
  /memory
    buffer.ts
    entity.ts
    summary.ts
    vector.ts
  chatWithMemory.ts
```

This keeps logic clean and makes swapping easy.

### üì¶ 7. Index Memory for Insights (Bonus)

Store memory states and LLM responses in Supabase for:

- Analytics
- Session replays
- Performance audits

```ts
await supabase.from("logs").insert({
  session_id: sessionId,
  memory: JSON.stringify(memoryState),
  input,
  output,
});
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 8. Gotchas to Watch Out For

- **Entity duplication**: e.g., "name": "Darshan", "Name": "John" ‚Äî normalize keys
- **Cross-user memory leakage**: Always scope memory by `sessionId` or `userId`
- **Overtrusting memory**: LLMs might hallucinate past facts
- **Conflicting memories**: Use precedence logic

```ts
const context = {
  ...summary,
  ...entities, // overwrite if needed
  ...vectorRecall,
};
```

### üß† Final Thought: Memory = UX + Infra

Great memory implementation is not just an LLM feature ‚Äî it‚Äôs a design challenge across UX, backend infra, and prompt architecture.

A chatbot that _remembers correctly_, _forgets appropriately_, and _asks when unsure_ feels magical ‚ú®

Congrats ‚Äî you now have a production-ready memory-driven AI chatbot! üöÄ

Next steps? Package it as a module, deploy to Vercel/Railway, or plug into WhatsApp/Instagram. Onward to real-world automation ü§ñ
