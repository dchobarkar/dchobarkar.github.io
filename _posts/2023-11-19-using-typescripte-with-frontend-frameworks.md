# TypeScript - 09: Using TypeScript with Frontend Frameworks

In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, TypeScript has emerged as a powerful ally for developers seeking to build robust, scalable, and maintainable frontend applications. TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, introduces static typing to the dynamic world of JavaScript, offering developers the tools to write clearer, more error-resistant code. This article series aims to explore the synergy between TypeScript and popular frontend frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular, providing insights into how TypeScript enhances the development experience.

## TypeScript and React

React's component-based architecture has revolutionized the way developers build user interfaces. Integrating TypeScript with React brings several benefits, including improved code quality through static typing and enhanced development efficiency with intelligent code completion and error detection.

### Setting Up TypeScript with React

To begin using TypeScript in a React project, start by creating a new React application using Create React App with TypeScript template:

```jsx
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

This command sets up a new React project configured with TypeScript, allowing you to start writing your components with TypeScript right away.

### Building a Simple Component

Consider a simple `TodoItem` component that displays a todo item:

```jsx
interface TodoItemProps {
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

const TodoItem: React.FC<TodoItemProps> = ({ title, completed }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>Status: {completed ? "Completed" : "Incomplete"}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TodoItem;
```

In this example, the `TodoItemProps` interface defines the shape of the props expected by the `TodoItem` component, leveraging TypeScript's static typing to ensure that each `TodoItem` receives the correct props.

## TypeScript with Vue

Vue's approachable, versatile, and performant characteristics make it an excellent choice for crafting modern web applications. When combined with TypeScript, Vue developers can enjoy a more structured development process, benefiting from type checking and enhanced editor support.

### Setting Up TypeScript with Vue

Creating a Vue project with TypeScript support can be quickly done using Vue CLI:

```jsx
vue create my-vue-app
# When prompted, choose "Manually select features" and select "TypeScript"
```

After the setup, you can start developing Vue components with TypeScript, enjoying the advantages of static typing and advanced tooling support.

### Building a Simple Component

A simple Vue component using TypeScript might look like this:

```jsx
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <button @click="toggleCompleted">{{ buttonText }}</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';

export default Vue.extend({
  props: {
    title: String,
    initialCompleted: Boolean
  },
  data() {
    return {
      completed: this.initialCompleted,
    };
  },
  computed: {
    buttonText(): string {
      return this.completed ? 'Mark as Incomplete' : 'Mark as Complete';
    },
  },
  methods: {
    toggleCompleted() {
      this.completed = !this.completed;
    },
  },
});
</script>
```

In this Vue component, TypeScript enhances the development experience by providing type checks and autocompletion for props, data, computed properties, and methods.

## TypeScript with Angular

Angular, designed with TypeScript as its primary language, leverages TypeScript's features to the fullest, offering a rich, integrated development experience. Angular's use of TypeScript enables powerful dependency injection, decorators, and tooling that significantly enhance the development and maintenance of large-scale applications.

### Setting Up TypeScript with Angular

Angular CLI, the command-line interface tool for Angular, inherently supports TypeScript. To start a new Angular project with TypeScript, simply run:

```jsx
ng new my-angular-app
```

This command creates a new Angular application that is already configured to use TypeScript, allowing you to dive straight into building your components, services, and modules using TypeScript's static typing and Angular's powerful features.

### Building a Simple Component

Consider a `UserProfile` component displaying user information:

```jsx
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: "app-user-profile",
  template: `
    <div>
      <h1>{{ user.name }}</h1>
      <p>Email: {{ user.email }}</p>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class UserProfileComponent {
  user: User = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  };
}
```

In this Angular example, the `User` interface defines the shape of the user object, and the `UserProfileComponent` uses this interface to ensure the structure of the `user` property. This integration showcases how TypeScript's type system can be used to define the expected structure of data in Angular applications.

## Example: Building a Small Application/Component with TypeScript

Let's explore how to use TypeScript to build a simple to-do list application with React as our chosen framework. This example will demonstrate the practical application of TypeScript in managing component state and props, showcasing the real-world benefits of using TypeScript in a frontend project.

### Setting Up the Project

After setting up a new React project with TypeScript (as shown in the first part of the article), create a new component named `TodoList.tsx` with the following structure:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

const TodoList: React.FC = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([]);

  // Function to add a new todo
  const addTodo = (todoText: string) => {
    const newTodo: Todo = {
      id: todos.length + 1,
      text: todoText,
      completed: false,
    };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
  };

  // Function to toggle todo completion
  const toggleTodoCompletion = (todoId: number) => {
    const updatedTodos = todos.map(todo =>
      todo.id === todoId ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
    );
    setTodos(updatedTodos);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>My Todo List</h2>
      {/* Todo list UI */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TodoList;
```

In this example, the `Todo` interface defines the structure of each todo item, ensuring that every todo added to the state matches this structure. The `useState` hook uses this interface to enforce the type of the `todos` state variable, illustrating how TypeScript enhances state management in React components.

## Best Practices for Using TypeScript with Frontend Frameworks

Integrating TypeScript with frontend frameworks requires adherence to certain best practices to fully leverage the advantages of type safety and enhance development efficiency. Here are some key guidelines:

- **Consistently Use Type Annotations**: Ensure that components, props, state, and functions are consistently annotated with types. This practice significantly reduces the chances of runtime errors and improves code readability.

- **Leverage Interface Segregation**: Define interfaces that are specific to components or functionality rather than using broad, generic interfaces. This makes your code more flexible and maintainable.

- **Utilize TypeScript's Advanced Types**: Make full use of TypeScript's advanced types like generics, union types, and intersection types to create flexible and reusable code structures.

- **Integrate Static Type Checking in Build Process**: Incorporate TypeScript's compiler or linters as part of your build and continuous integration process to catch type errors early in the development cycle.

- **Explore and Contribute to DefinitelyTyped**: Engage with the DefinitelyTyped community to find or contribute type definitions for third-party libraries, enriching the ecosystem and enhancing the development experience for everyone.
